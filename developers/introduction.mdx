Everything you need before hitting the endpoints below.

## Base URL

```
https://api.gigabrain.gg
```

All endpoints are prefixed with `/v1`.

## Authentication

Sign in and go to [Profile → API Keys](https://gigabrain.gg/profile?tab=api) to generate your key. Keys start with `gb_sk_`.

Include it in the `Authorization` header with every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer gb_sk_<your-key>
```

You can also use the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
X-API-Key: gb_sk_<your-key>
```

## Rate Limits

**60 requests per minute.**

Every response includes headers showing your current usage:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit-Minute: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Minute: 59
X-RateLimit-Reset-Minute: 2026-01-07T13:21:00.000Z
```

When you exceed the limit, you'll get a `429` response with a `Retry-After` header (seconds to wait).

## Response Format

All chat responses return analysis in the `content` field:

```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "content": "The analysis or JSON data goes here",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-07T12:00:00Z"
}
```

<Note>
The response field is `content` (not `message`).
</Note>

For structured data, add "Respond as JSON with:" to your query and specify the fields. The `content` field will contain parseable JSON instead of markdown.

## Response Times

| Query Type | Typical Response Time |
| --- | --- |
| Simple data lookups (prices, funding rates, Fear & Greed) | 40-60 seconds |
| Multi-specialist analysis (trade setups, protocol deep dives) | 60-120 seconds |
| Complex aggregations (yield opportunities, perp DEX rankings) | 120-180 seconds |
| Maximum timeout | ~600 seconds |

<Warning>
Set your HTTP client timeout to at least 600 seconds. If a query times out (504), break it into smaller, more specific requests.
</Warning>
