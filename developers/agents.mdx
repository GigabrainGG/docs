Gigabrain Agents enable you to build autonomous AI systems that leverage the Intelligence Collective for real-time market analysis, decision-making, and automated trading strategies.

## What are Gigabrain Agents?

Agents are autonomous programs that interact with the Gigabrain API to:

- **Analyze markets** in real-time using AI-powered insights
- **Make decisions** based on the Intelligence Collective's analysis
- **Execute strategies** automatically without manual intervention
- **Adapt and learn** from market conditions and outcomes

Think of agents as your personal AI trading assistants that work 24/7, combining Gigabrain's market intelligence with your custom logic and risk parameters.

## Key Capabilities

### Market Analysis

Agents can query the Intelligence Collective for:

- Price predictions and trend analysis
- Support and resistance levels
- Market sentiment and social signals
- Technical indicator interpretations
- Risk assessments and probability estimates

### Automated Decision Making

Build agents that:

- Monitor multiple assets simultaneously
- Evaluate entry and exit opportunities
- Calculate position sizes based on risk parameters
- Manage stop-loss and take-profit levels
- Rebalance portfolios dynamically

### Integration Flexibility

Agents can integrate with:

- **Trading platforms**: Hyperliquid, dYdX, Binance, Coinbase
- **Data sources**: On-chain data, price feeds, social metrics
- **Notification systems**: Telegram, Discord, email, webhooks
- **Custom logic**: Your proprietary strategies and algorithms

## Use Cases

### Automated Trading Bots

Build bots that execute trades based on Gigabrain's analysis:

```python
# Example: Simple trading agent
agent = GigabrainAgent(api_key="gb_sk_...")

# Get market analysis
analysis = agent.analyze("Should I buy BTC at current levels?")

# Execute based on confidence
if analysis.confidence > 0.75 and analysis.recommendation == "BUY":
    agent.execute_trade(symbol="BTC", side="long", size=0.1)
```

### Portfolio Management

Create agents that manage and rebalance portfolios:

- Monitor portfolio performance
- Identify rebalancing opportunities
- Execute trades to maintain target allocations
- Adjust risk exposure based on market conditions

### Alert Systems

Build intelligent alert systems that notify you of:

- High-confidence trading opportunities
- Risk warnings and market anomalies
- Portfolio threshold breaches
- Custom condition triggers

### Research and Backtesting

Use agents for:

- Automated strategy backtesting
- Market research and data collection
- Performance tracking and analytics
- Strategy optimization and refinement

## Agent Architecture

A typical Gigabrain agent consists of:

### 1. Analysis Layer

Queries the Intelligence Collective for market insights:

```python
response = gigabrain.chat(
    message="Analyze BTC 4H chart and provide entry/exit levels"
)
```

### 2. Decision Layer

Processes analysis and applies your custom logic:

```python
def should_enter_trade(analysis, portfolio, risk_params):
    # Your custom decision logic
    if analysis.confidence > risk_params.min_confidence:
        if portfolio.available_capital > risk_params.min_trade_size:
            return True
    return False
```

### 3. Execution Layer

Executes actions based on decisions:

```python
if should_enter_trade(analysis, portfolio, risk_params):
    exchange.place_order(
        symbol="BTC-USD",
        side="buy",
        size=calculate_position_size(analysis, risk_params)
    )
```

### 4. Monitoring Layer

Tracks performance and manages positions:

```python
# Monitor open positions
for position in portfolio.open_positions:
    current_pnl = position.calculate_pnl()
    
    # Check stop-loss
    if current_pnl < position.stop_loss:
        exchange.close_position(position)
```

## Agent Types

### Event-Driven Agents

Respond to specific market events or conditions:

- Price breakouts or breakdowns
- Volume spikes or anomalies
- News and social sentiment shifts
- Technical indicator signals

### Scheduled Agents

Run on a regular schedule:

- Hourly market analysis
- Daily portfolio rebalancing
- Weekly performance reports
- Monthly strategy reviews

### Continuous Agents

Run continuously, monitoring markets 24/7:

- Real-time opportunity detection
- Active position management
- Dynamic risk adjustment
- Instant alert notifications

## Best Practices

### Risk Management

- **Always use stop-losses**: Protect against unexpected market moves
- **Position sizing**: Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- **Diversification**: Don't put all capital in a single position
- **Rate limits**: Respect API rate limits to avoid service disruption

### Testing and Validation

- **Paper trading first**: Test strategies with simulated capital
- **Backtesting**: Validate strategies on historical data
- **Gradual scaling**: Start small and scale up as confidence grows
- **Continuous monitoring**: Regularly review agent performance

### Security

- **Secure API keys**: Never expose keys in code or logs
- **Environment variables**: Store sensitive data securely
- **Access controls**: Limit agent permissions to necessary functions
- **Audit logging**: Track all agent actions for accountability

### Reliability

- **Error handling**: Implement robust error handling and recovery
- **Failsafes**: Build in circuit breakers and emergency stops
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for agent failures or anomalies
- **Redundancy**: Consider backup systems for critical agents

## Getting Started

Ready to build your first agent? Check out our [Agent Setup Guide](/developers/agent-setup) for step-by-step instructions.

### Quick Start

1. **Get your API key** from [Profile → API Keys](https://gigabrain.gg/profile)
2. **Choose your stack**: Python, Node.js, or your preferred language
3. **Install dependencies**: Use our official SDKs or HTTP client
4. **Build your agent**: Start with a simple example and iterate
5. **Test thoroughly**: Paper trade before using real capital
6. **Deploy and monitor**: Run your agent and track performance

## Example Agents

### Simple Price Alert Agent

```python
import requests
import time

API_KEY = "gb_sk_..."
BASE_URL = "https://api.gigabrain.gg"

def check_btc_opportunity():
    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/chat",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"},
        json={"message": "Is now a good time to buy BTC?"}
    )
    
    analysis = response.json()
    print(f"Analysis: {analysis['message']}")
    
    # Add your logic to send alerts, execute trades, etc.

# Run every hour
while True:
    check_btc_opportunity()
    time.sleep(3600)
```

### Multi-Asset Monitoring Agent

```javascript
const API_KEY = "gb_sk_...";
const ASSETS = ["BTC", "ETH", "SOL"];

async function analyzeAssets() {
  for (const asset of ASSETS) {
    const res = await fetch("https://api.gigabrain.gg/v1/chat", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: `Analyze ${asset} and provide trading recommendation`,
      }),
    });

    const analysis = await res.json();
    console.log(`${asset}: ${analysis.message}`);

    // Process analysis and take action
  }
}

// Run every 15 minutes
setInterval(analyzeAssets, 15 * 60 * 1000);
```
