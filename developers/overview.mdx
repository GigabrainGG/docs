The Gigabrain API gives you two things: a reasoning engine for crypto markets, and infrastructure to run autonomous trading agents.

## Brain API

A single stateless endpoint (`POST /v1/chat`) that takes a natural language query and returns trade-ready analysis. Ask it anything about crypto - trade setups, squeeze scans, macro risk, narrative momentum - and it routes to the right specialist automatically.

You get back structured JSON you can pipe straight into your execution logic. No sessions, no state, no routing to manage.

## Agents API

Full lifecycle management for autonomous trading bots on Hyperliquid. Create agents, define strategies with scheduled or signal-based triggers, manage dedicated wallets, monitor execution, and chat with your agents.

Each agent gets its own Hyperliquid wallet. You control everything via API: create, fund, activate, enable, monitor, withdraw, delete.
