Gigabrain is a cutting-edge, AI-powered trading intelligence platform that delivers an institutional-grade edge to crypto traders. It was founded on the vision of leveling the playing field: for too long, elite market intelligence has been the exclusive domain of big institutions, giving them a decisive advantage over individual traders. Gigabrain changes this by harnessing advanced artificial intelligence and vast data streams to provide real-time market signals, predictive analytics, and comprehensive insights all in one terminal.

Built by traders for traders, Gigabrain focuses on the tools and information that genuinely move the needle. 

The results speak for themselves: in its beta testing, Gigabrain's Test Fund achieved a 92.86% win rate (13 out of 14 trades), generating $1,345 in profit from an initial capital of $4,900, with the top performer being a short position on $ENA. 

In short, Gigabrain empowers crypto enthusiasts with a powerful intelligence platform previously available only to Wall Street-level players, enabling faster, smarter, and more confident trading decisions.
