Create, configure, and launch your first autonomous trading agent in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before creating an agent, ensure the following:

- **Exchange connected** — Link your Hyperliquid account in [Profile → Integrations](https://gigabrain.gg/profile?tab=integrations). See the [Integrations guide](/guides/integrations) for setup instructions.
- **API credits available** — Your account must have sufficient API credits to run agent analysis cycles.
- **Telegram connected** — To receive real-time notifications, connect Telegram in [Profile → Integrations](https://gigabrain.gg/profile?tab=integrations).

## Create an agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Agents">
    - Go to the [Agents page](https://gigabrain.gg/agents).
    - Click **Create New Agent**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure agent settings">
    - **Name** — Give your agent a descriptive name (e.g., "BTC Momentum Scanner"). 
    - **Analysis frequency** — Select how often the agent evaluates the market: Real-time, Hourly, or Daily.
    - **Alpha triggers** *(optional)* — Enable to have your agent react to breaking news and market events. Alpha-based agents support filtering by event type (protocol hacks, macro shocks, geopolitical events, etc.).
    - **Memory** *(optional)* — Enable to let the agent learn from past trades and market conditions, improving its decision-making over time. See [Memory & Learning](/guides/agents-building#memory-%26-learning) for details.
    - **Trading** *(optional)* — Enable to allow the agent to execute trades. A dedicated trading wallet is deployed per agent. Leave disabled for notification only agents.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Define your strategy">
    - **Set a goal** — Describe your agent's primary objective. This guides the agent's analysis and decision-making.
    - **Write instructions** — Define the strategy logic your agent should follow. Structure your instructions with clear sections:
       - **Entry conditions** — When the agent should open a position
       - **Position sizing** — How much capital to allocate per trade
       - **Exit rules** — Take-profit, stop-loss, and time-based exits
       - **Risk management** — Daily loss limits, maximum concurrent positions
       - **Guardrails** — Conditions under which the agent must not trade

  </Step>

  <Step title="Fund and monitor">
    - **Fund your agent wallet** — Transfer USDC to your agent's wallet from Hyperliquid. You can find the wallet address on the agent's detail page.
    - **Monitor performance** — Track your agent's trades, P&L, and reasoning in the **Portfolio** tab on the agent page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Export your wallet keys before deleting an agent.** Each agent has a dedicated wallet. Go to the agent's **Settings** to export your private keys. Deleting an agent without exporting its keys results in permanent, irrecoverable loss of any remaining funds.
</Warning>
