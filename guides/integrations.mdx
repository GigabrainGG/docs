<Warning>
Gigabrain is non-custodial. We never have access to your funds. Exchange API keys only allow Gigabrain to place orders you configure, it cannot withdraw funds. Never share your wallet seed phrase or recovery phrase through the platform.

### Key considerations

- **Execution risk**: Orders are submitted to Hyperliquid under its rules. Slippage, partial fills, and liquidation mechanics are controlled by Hyperliquid, not Gigabrain. See the [Risk Disclosure](/support/risk-disclosure) for details.
