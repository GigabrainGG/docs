## Getting Started

### Step 1: Navigate to Agents

1. Visit [Agents page](https://gigabrain.gg/agents)
2. Click **Create New Agent** to begin

### Step 2: Configure your agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define strategy">
    Write your agent's strategy in natural language in the input box. Be specific about:
    - Entry conditions (e.g., confidence thresholds, market state requirements)
    - Exit strategy (e.g., invalidation points, confidence drops)
    - Risk management rules (e.g., position sizing, stop losses)
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Analyze the 4H BTC chart, microstructure data, and whale positioning
    every 4 hours. Place a trade with 10% of account margin when:
    - Confidence exceeds 75%
    - Market State is Risk-On
    - Funding rate is neutral or favorable
    
    Re-analyze open positions every 30 minutes. Close position if:
    - Invalidation point is hit
    - Confidence drops below 50%
    - Macro Analyst flags high-impact geopolitical event
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm your strategy">
    Review the generated strategy details:
    - **Analysis Frequency**: How often your agent will analyze market conditions (Real-time, Hourly, or Daily)
    - **Position Sizing**: Fixed amount or percentage of portfolio
    - **Leverage**: Leverage multiplier for trades
    - **Confidence Threshold**: Minimum confidence required to execute
    - **Specialists**: Which analysts will be consulted
    
    Make any necessary adjustments and click **Confirm** to proceed.
  </Step>
</Steps>
