This Risk Disclosure Statement (the “**Risk Disclosure**”) is provided by Brain Labs Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (together with its affiliates, subsidiaries and any related entities, “**Gigabrain**”, “**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**”) and applies to your access to and use of our website available at [https://gigabrain.gg/](https://gigabrain.gg/), any sub-domains, mobile applications, terminals, dashboards, APIs, software, community channels and other products and services we make available now or in the future, including any features described as chat interface, alpha feed, research and monitoring features, token-gated features, execution integrations, reasoning, market intelligence feeds, event intelligence, alerts, workflows, and automation tasks (collectively, the “**Services**”). This Risk Disclosure is incorporated into and forms part of Gigabrain’s [Terms of Service](https://gigabrain.gg/legal/terms-of-service). Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings set out in the Terms of Service.
This Risk Disclosure is intended to help you understand the key risks associated with using the Services. It does not describe all risks, and you should not interpret it as legal, tax, financial, or investment advice. You are solely responsible for evaluating whether the Services are suitable for you, and for all decisions you make based on your use of the Services.

By accessing or using the Services, you acknowledge that you understand and accept the risks described in this Risk Disclosure, and that you assume full responsibility for any outcomes, including losses.

1. **No Financial, Investment, Legal or Tax Advice.**

   i. The Services provide information and tooling for research and monitoring. Gigabrain does not provide financial, investment, legal, accounting, or tax advice, does not act as a broker, dealer, exchange, or investment adviser, and does not recommend or endorse any asset, strategy, transaction, or course of action.

   ii. Any content, output, commentary, or structured information provided through the Services, including any examples of levels, ranges, scenarios, risk framing, or parameters, is provided for informational and educational purposes only and is not a directive to trade.

2. **Cryptocurrency & Digital Assets Market Risk.**

   i. Digital assets are highly volatile. Prices may fluctuate significantly within short periods due to market sentiment, macroeconomic events, protocol changes, exchange incidents, liquidity conditions, or other factors. You may lose some or all of the funds you deploy in connection with digital asset activity.

   ii. Digital asset markets may be illiquid. Limited liquidity can lead to large price movements, inability to enter or exit positions at desired prices, significant slippage, partial fills, and heightened losses.

   iii. Digital asset markets operate continuously. Events can occur outside typical business hours, and rapid changes can occur while you are offline. Gigabrain is not responsible for missed opportunities or losses caused by market moves occurring at any time.

3. **Derivatives, Perpetuals & Leverage Risks (Where Applicable).**

   i. If you trade derivatives, perpetual contracts, or leveraged products through third party execution venues, you acknowledge that such instruments can amplify gains and losses and may result in the rapid loss of your entire position, collateral, or deposited funds.

   ii. Leverage increases the likelihood of liquidation, margin calls, forced position reductions, or other adverse outcomes under the rules of the execution venue. These outcomes may occur with little or no notice based on market conditions and venue mechanics.

   iii. Funding rates, mark prices, liquidation engines, insurance funds, and other venue-specific mechanisms can materially affect your outcomes. Gigabrain does not control these mechanisms and is not responsible for losses arising from them.

4. **AI and Automated Output Risks.**

   i. The Services may use automated systems, including artificial intelligence and algorithmic processes, to generate outputs such as summaries, classifications, explanations, scenario analysis, or other structured responses. AI outputs are probabilistic and may contain errors, omissions, or misleading conclusions.

   ii. AI outputs may be incorrect for many reasons, including limitations of training data, ambiguity in prompts, incomplete context, model uncertainty, data latency, or unexpected market regimes. AI outputs may not reflect real-time conditions, may fail to incorporate breaking events, and may not account for your individual circumstances.

   iii. You should not rely on AI outputs as a substitute for independent judgment, independent verification, or professional advice. You are responsible for validating any information that is important to your decisions, including by consulting primary sources and verifying market conditions directly.

   iv. Gigabrain does not guarantee accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or usefulness of any output. Any confidence scoring, prioritization, or ranking is not a guarantee of outcome and does not imply reduced risk.

5. **Data Quality, Third Party Data & Timing Risks.**

   i. The Services may display, aggregate, or reference information from third parties, including market data providers, blockchain networks, indexers, social platforms, and execution venues. Such information may be delayed, incomplete, inaccurate, or unavailable.

   ii. Market data and on-chain data may be affected by outages, node failures, indexing delays, chain reorganizations, API limitations, rate limits, or other disruptions. Indicators may change after the fact or appear differently across data sources.

   iii. News, social signals, or event intelligence may be incomplete, speculative, or misleading. Gigabrain does not guarantee that any event is correctly interpreted or that any event will result in a particular market outcome.

6. **Third Party Platform Risks.**

   i. The Services may allow you to connect and use third party execution venues (for example, Hyperliquid) and may provide tooling that helps you submit orders or manage positions on such venues. Any execution occurs on third party platforms under their own rules, terms, and policies.

   ii. Gigabrain does not operate, control, or guarantee the performance, availability, security, or solvency of any third party platform. Third party platforms may experience downtime, degraded performance, unexpected maintenance, hacks, exploits, insolvency, governance actions, or operational failures.

   iii. Order outcomes may differ from what you intend due to venue rules, latency, network congestion, slippage, partial fills, liquidation mechanics, position limits, risk checks, or other factors. Gigabrain is not responsible for execution outcomes, including failures, rejected orders, partial executions, or adverse fills.

   iv. Third party platforms may impose geographic restrictions, sanctions screening, access limitations, account restrictions, or other controls. Your access to such platforms may be restricted or revoked by the third party at any time, and Gigabrain is not responsible for such restrictions.

7. **Automation & Workflows Risks (Where Applicable).**

   i. Certain features may allow you to configure workflows, rules, alerts, autotrade, vault participation, or other automated actions that may submit orders or take actions based on your prior configuration. Automation can increase the risk of unintended actions, repeated actions, or actions taken under conditions you did not anticipate. Automation may execute during fast-moving or illiquid market conditions, resulting in significant slippage, rapid drawdowns, or liquidation. Automation may also be affected by data latency, incorrect signals, incorrect configurations, or connectivity issues.

   ii. You are solely responsible for configuring, testing, enabling, disabling, and monitoring any automation, where applicable. You should use conservative limits, carefully review parameters, and ensure you understand how automation interacts with execution venue mechanics.

   iii. Gigabrain may suspend or disable automation features (if made available) for operational or security reasons. Such actions may occur without notice and may affect your intended strategy execution.

8. **Non-Custodial Nature.**

   i. Gigabrain does not custody your funds or digital assets. You remain solely responsible for the custody and security of your wallet(s), private keys, agent keys, seed phrases, and recovery phrases.

   ii. If you provide execution credentials to enable third party integrations, you acknowledge that compromise of such credentials may result in unauthorized actions on the execution venue. You are responsible for credential hygiene, including safe storage, rotation, revocation, and limiting permissions where possible.

   iii. Gigabrain does not request and you must never provide your wallet seed phrase or recovery phrase through the Services. If any interface or communication appears to request seed phrases, you should treat it as suspicious and refrain from submitting such information.

   iv. You acknowledge that phishing, malware, SIM swaps, social engineering, and wallet exploits are common in the crypto ecosystem. Gigabrain is not responsible for losses arising from compromise of your devices, accounts, wallets, credentials, or third party services.

9. **Smart Contract & Blockchain Risks.**

Blockchain networks and smart contracts can fail, be exploited, be upgraded in unexpected ways, or exhibit emergent behavior. On-chain transactions may be irreversible, and mistakes can result in permanent loss. Network congestion, high fees, chain halts, forks, consensus failures, or validator issues may affect your ability to move funds, manage positions, or meet margin requirements on third party platforms. Gigabrain does not control blockchain networks and is not responsible for their operation.

10. **Token-Gating & Token Risks.**

    i. Certain features may be token-gated, meaning you must hold a token or meet an on-chain eligibility threshold to access those features. Eligibility can change at any time due to transfers, sales, custody arrangements, smart wallet structures, or on-chain activity. If you no longer meet the eligibility threshold, you may lose access to token-gated features, including without prior notice.

    ii. Any reference to tokens, token holdings, or token-gated access relates solely to eligibility for features or benefits within the Services. Gigabrain does not guarantee token value, liquidity, availability, or market performance, and does not control secondary markets for tokens. 

    iii. Gigabrain may modify, suspend, replace, or discontinue token-gated features, eligibility thresholds, or associated benefits at any time for technical, legal, operational, or business reasons. You should not acquire or hold any token in reliance on the continued availability of any feature or benefit.

11. **Service Availability & Operational Risks.** 

The Services may be unavailable, delayed, or degraded from time to time due to maintenance, upgrades, technical failures, third party outages, network congestion, or other operational reasons. During such periods, you may be unable to access outputs, alerts, or execution-related tools. Gigabrain does not guarantee uninterrupted availability, and is not responsible for losses arising from downtime, errors, latency, or inability to access the Services when needed.

12. **Tax, Regulatory & Legal Risks.**

    i. Digital asset activity may have tax consequences, including income, capital gains, withholding, reporting, and other obligations. Tax treatment can vary by jurisdiction and can change. You are solely responsible for determining and satisfying your tax obligations.

    ii. Laws and regulations relating to digital assets, derivatives (if applicable), and software tools may change rapidly and may be unclear or inconsistently enforced. Your use of the Services and any trading activity you conduct may be restricted or prohibited in some jurisdictions. You are responsible for ensuring your compliance with applicable law.

13. **No Guarantees & Reliance on Past Performance.**

Gigabrain does not guarantee any particular outcome from using the Services, including profitability, accuracy, or avoidance of losses. Any historical analysis, backtesting, sample results, or past performance information (if provided) is not predictive of future results. You acknowledge that any decision you make based on the Services is made at your own risk, and you are responsible for independently assessing and managing that risk.

14. **Acknowledgement & Acceptance.**

    i. By accessing or using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Risk Disclosure and that you accept the risks described. If you do not understand these risks, you should not use the Services.

    ii. If you choose to use the Services, you accept full responsibility for your use, including any trading activity you initiate or authorize through third party platforms, and any losses that may result.
