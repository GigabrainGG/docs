  <Accordion title="What is Gigabrain?">
    Gigabrain is a market intelligence platform for crypto trading. It analyzes markets in real-time by combining price data, onchain metrics, derivatives positioning, fundamentals, news, and social sentiment. You ask questions in natural language and get structured analysis with clear trade theses, supporting data, and risk assessments.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is this different from ChatGPT or other AI tools?">
  ChatGPT is a general purpose AI with a knowledge cutoff it doesn't have access
  to live market data or specialized crypto analysis tools. Gigabrain pulls
  real-time prices, funding rates, onchain flows, whale activity, and news as
  you query. It's built specifically for crypto trading with specialized
  analysts for macro, microstructure, fundamentals, technicals, and more.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need coding skills to use Gigabrain?">
  No. Chat works entirely through natural language just type questions like
  "Analyze ETH on the 4H chart"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I try it before paying?">
  Yes. You can explore Alpha Feed and for chat access and agents access you will
  need API credits
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What kind of questions can I ask?">
    Anything related to crypto markets:
    - Trade setups: "Give me a BTC long setup on the 1H chart"
    - Market conditions: "What's moving the market today?"
    - Fundamentals: "Analyze Aave's TVL and revenue"
    - Positioning: "Are longs crowded on SOL?"
    - Macro: "Is the market risk on or risk off right now?"
    - Data requests: "Get token unlocks for next 14 days"

    See the [Chat documentation](/core-features/chat) for more examples.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How accurate is the analysis?">
  Gigabrain synthesizes current market data and applies established analytical
  frameworks (technical analysis, onchain metrics, macro correlations). It's as
  accurate as the data it receives and the patterns it recognizes. However,
  markets are inherently unpredictable no analysis tool can guarantee future
  price movements. Use Gigabrain to inform your decisions, not replace your
  judgment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I execute trades directly from Chat?">
  Yes, if you connect your exchange account in Integrations. Once connected, you
  can ask Chat to place trades like "Long ETH with $500 at 5x leverage" and it
  will execute after confirmation. See [Integrations](/guides/integrations) for
  setup details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Chat remember my previous questions?">
  Yes, within the same conversation session. You can ask follow up questions
  without repeating context. For example, after asking "Analyze BTC," you can
  follow up with "What about the fundamentals?" and it will understand you're
  still talking about BTC. Starting a new chat resets the context.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How current is the data in Chat responses?">
  Data is pulled in real-time when you query. Prices, funding rates, and most
  market metrics are current within seconds.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the Alpha Feed?">
  Alpha is an automated intelligence feed that surfaces market moving events as
  they happen. It monitors news, onchain activity, social signals, whale
  movements, and macro developments, then alerts you to things that could affect
  prices before they reach mainstream awareness.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is Alpha different from just reading crypto news?">
  News sites show you everything most of it is noise. Alpha filters for events
  with actual price relevance, provides context on why it matters, cross
  references with current market data, and assigns impact ratings. It's
  synthesized intelligence not raw headlines.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I filter Alpha by topic?">
  Yes. You can filter by category (MACRO, FUNDAMENTALS, WHALES, ONCHAIN,
  INSTITUTIONAL, MARKET STRUCTURE) and view only STARRED insights you've
  bookmarked.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are Agents?">
  Agents are autonomous programs that execute trading strategies on your behalf.
  You define the rules (when to enter, how much to risk, when to exit), connect
  your exchange, and the Agent monitors markets 24/7 and trades when your
  criteria are met.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do Agents trade automatically without my approval?">
  Yes, that's the point. You set the strategy in the Instructions, and the Agent
  executes automatically when conditions match. If you want manual approval for
  each trade, use Chat with exchange integration instead Chat requires you to
  explicitly request each trade.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I see what my Agent is thinking before it trades?">
  Yes. Every Agent run produces a reasoning trace in the Reasoning tab that
  shows exactly what data it analyzed, which criteria were met or not met, and
  why it decided to trade or stay sidelined. You can review these in real-time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my Agent makes bad trades?">
  Agents execute the strategy you define. If trades are unprofitable, the
  strategy needs refinement adjust your Instructions based on what you learn
  from the Learnings tab. Start with small position sizes, tight stop losses,
  and daily profit caps until you're confident the strategy works.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I pause my Agent if the market gets crazy?">
  Yes. Click the Pause button and the Agent stops immediately. You can resume it
  anytime. You can also set risk limits in your Instructions like "Halt all
  trading if account drops to $X" or "Stop trading during high VIX
  environments."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I run multiple Agents at once?">
  Yes. You can deploy multiple Agents with different strategies on different
  assets or timeframes. For example, one Agent could scalp BTC on 5m while
  another swing trades ETH on 4H.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which exchanges does Gigabrain support?">
  Currently supported exchanges are listed in the Integrations section of your
  account settings. This includes major perpetual futures platforms. The list is
  updated as new integrations are added.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can Gigabrain withdraw funds from my exchange?">
  No. APIs wallets used for trade execution does not have withdrawal
  permissions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I backtest strategies before running an Agent live?">
  Yes, you can run paper trading with your Agent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I analyze my own portfolio?">
  Yes. You can ask Chat questions like "Analyze a portfolio of 50% BTC, 30% ETH,
  20% SOL" and get risk assessment, correlation analysis, and suggestions for
  rebalancing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Gigabrain provide price predictions?">
  No. Gigabrain analyzes current conditions and identifies potential setups
  based on technical, fundamental, macro, and positioning factors. It provides
  probabilistic assessments (e.g., "bearish bias until support holds") not price
  targets with certainty.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between the specialists?">
    Each specialist focuses on one domain of market analysis:
    - **Macro** examines Fed policy, DXY, yields, risk environment
    - **Microstructure** tracks funding rates, open interest, liquidations
    - **Fundamentals** analyzes TVL, revenue, protocol health
    - **Price Movement** does technical analysis and chart patterns
    - **Market State** assesses overall sentiment and narratives
    - **Trenches** focuses on low cap tokens and social momentum
    - **Polymarket** interprets prediction market odds

    When you ask a question, the relevant specialists are consulted automatically. See [What is Gigabrain](/index#the-brain) for full details.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I get raw data without analysis?">
  Yes. You can request specific data points like "Get funding rates for top 20
  perpetual contracts" or "Get token unlocks for next 14 days" and receive
  structured data with minimal commentary.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between pay-as-you-go and token-gated access?">
    **Pay-as-you-go**: Start at $5, pay per Chat query, includes API and Agents access.

    **Token-gated (1M BRAIN)**: Hold 1M BRAIN tokens for unlimited Chat, included monthly API credits, and access to Alpha Community.

    See [Pricing](/pricing) for full comparison.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does each Chat query cost with pay-as-you-go?">
  Pricing is usage based and depends on query complexity. Simple questions
  consume fewer credits than multi specialist deep dives. Your account dashboard
  shows credit consumption per query.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do API credits expire?">
  API Credits purchased has expiry date of 1 year.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Gigabrain to build my own trading bot?">
  Yes. All Chat queries can return structured JSON responses when you add
  "Respond as JSON" to your question. This enables programmatic integration for
  bots, dashboards, and automated systems. See the [Brain API
  documentation](/developers/brain-api-overview) for implementation details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does trading via Gigabrain incur any fees?">
  Yes. Trading via Gigabrain incurs a small fee charged as builder fees. This
  applies to trades executed through Chat (when exchange is connected) and
  trades executed by Agents.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I self-host Gigabrain?">
  No. Gigabrain runs on cloud infrastructure with access to real-time data
  feeds, exchange integrations, and the Brain. It's not
  available for self-hosting.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the Alpha Community?">
  A private community for BRAIN token holders (1M+ tokens). It includes
  exclusive channels for strategy discussion, early alpha sharing, and direct
  interaction with the Gigabrain team.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get support if something doesn't work?">
  For technical issues and general discussion, join the [Gigabrain
  Telegram](https://t.me/gigabraingg).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I request new features or data sources?">
  Yes. Feature requests are welcome via the community channels. The team
  prioritizes features based on user demand and technical feasibility.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there documentation for developers?">
  Yes. The Brain API documentation covers structured JSON output, programmatic
  query formatting, and integration patterns for building custom tools. Access
  it from [Brain API Overview](/developers/brain-api-overview).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Gigabrain financial advice?">
  No. Gigabrain is a tool for market analysis and trade execution. It does not
  provide personalized financial advice or recommendations. You are responsible
  for your own trading decisions and risk management.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I rely on Gigabrain to manage my entire trading account?">
  You should never rely solely on any automated tool for all trading decisions.
  Use Gigabrain to inform your analysis, validate your ideas, and execute
  strategies you understand. Always maintain appropriate position sizing, stop
  losses, and risk limits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if Gigabrain's analysis is wrong?">
  Markets are unpredictable. Even high conviction analysis can be invalidated by
  unexpected events (regulatory changes, exchange hacks, black swan events).
  This is why every response includes invalidation criteria conditions under
  which the thesis no longer holds. Use stop losses, position size
  appropriately, and never risk more than you can afford to lose.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who is responsible if an Agent loses money?">
    Agents execute strategies you define with rules you set. Profitable or unprofitable outcomes result from the strategy, market conditions, and your risk management not from Gigabrain making decisions on your behalf.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my agent wallet if I delete an agent?">
    Each agent has a dedicated trading wallet. If you delete an agent without first exporting the wallet's private keys, any remaining funds in that wallet are permanently lost and cannot be recovered. Always go to the agent's **Settings** page and export your private keys before deleting. See the [Agent Setup Guide](/guides/agents-setup) for details.
