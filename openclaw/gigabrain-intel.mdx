# Gigabrain - The Brain

Query real-time crypto market data from 7 specialists.

## Authentication

- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <GIGABRAIN_API_KEY>`
- Key format: `gb_sk_...`
- Get your key: https://gigabrain.gg/profile?tab=api

## Base URL

https://api.gigabrain.gg

## Endpoint

### POST /v1/chat

Send a natural language query to the Brain. The query is automatically routed to the most relevant analyst(s).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "your query here"
}
```

**Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer <GIGABRAIN_API_KEY>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "content": "response text or JSON string",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-07T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- The response field is `content`, NOT `message`
- Set HTTP timeout to at least 600 seconds. Complex queries can take up to 10 minutes
- Each query consumes credits. Check your balance at https://gigabrain.gg/profile
- For structured data, append "Respond as JSON with: field1, field2, ..." to your query

## Rate Limits

- 60 requests per minute
- Monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Minute` header
- On 429 response: wait the number of seconds in the `Retry-After` header, then retry

## Available Analysts

1. **Macro** - DXY, VIX, Treasury yields (2Y, 10Y), Fed Funds rate, S&P 500/Nasdaq, gold, risk regime classification, crypto-macro correlations
2. **Microstructure** - Funding rates, open interest, liquidations, long/short ratios, whale positioning, taker flow imbalance, CVD
3. **Fundamentals** - TVL, protocol revenue, fees, chain deployments, active users, governance data, token metrics (price, market cap, PE ratio)
4. **Market State** - Fear & Greed Index, BTC dominance, Altcoin Season Index, total market cap, volume, narrative tracking, regime classification
5. **Price Movement** - EMAs (20, 50, 200), RSI, MACD, ADX, Supertrend, support/resistance levels, volume analysis, trade setups with entry/exit/stop-loss
6. **Trenches** - Micro-cap tokens (under $100M mcap), social momentum, KOL/influencer mentions, narrative analysis, volume spikes, risk assessment
7. **Polymarket** - Prediction markets, trending markets, odds (yes/no), volume, resolution dates, cross-referencing with macro and crypto data

## Query Patterns

**Simple query:**
```
What is the current price of ETH?
```

**Structured JSON query (recommended for automation):**
```
Get funding rates for top 10 perps. Respond as JSON array with: symbol, funding_rate, open_interest, long_short_ratio
```

**Multi-analyst query:**
```
Analyze ETH with technical and microstructure analysis on the 4H timeframe
```

**Macro overview:**
```
Get current macro indicators. Respond as JSON with: dxy (value, change_24h), vix (value, change_24h), us_10y_yield, fed_funds_rate, sp500_change_24h, risk_regime
```

## Error Handling

- 401: Invalid or revoked API key - verify at https://gigabrain.gg/profile?tab=api
- 429: Rate limit exceeded - wait `Retry-After` seconds before retrying
- 500/503: Server error - retry with exponential backoff
- 504: Query timeout - break into smaller, more specific queries
- Always log `session_id` from responses for debugging
````

## Example Queries

Once the skill is added, your agent can handle queries like:

| Query | Analyst |
|-------|---------|
| "What's the current macro risk regime?" | Macro |
| "Are longs crowded on ETH? Check funding rates and OI" | Microstructure |
| "Get top DeFi protocols by TVL as JSON" | Fundamentals |
| "What's the market sentiment right now?" | Market State |
| "Give me a technical analysis of SOL on the 4H chart" | Price Movement |
| "Find micro-cap tokens with unusual social momentum" | Trenches |
| "What are the top Polymarket predictions for crypto?" | Polymarket |

For automation, always use the structured JSON query pattern:

```
Get [data you need]. Respond as JSON with: field1, field2, field3
```
