[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) is an open standard for teaching AI agents new capabilities via `SKILL.md` files. Add a skill to your agent once, and it works everywhere.

Gigabrain provides two official skills that give any compatible agent access to real-time crypto market intelligence and autonomous trading on Hyperliquid. Works with **[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/)**, **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, **OpenAI Codex**, **Gemini CLI**, **Windsurf**, and [26+ other platforms](https://agentskills.io/home).

## Getting Started

1. **Get your API key** - Generate one at [gigabrain.gg/profile](https://gigabrain.gg/profile?tab=api). It will start with `gb_sk_`.
2. **Set the environment variable** - `export GIGABRAIN_API_KEY=gb_sk_your_key_here`
3. **Add a skill** - Copy the `SKILL.md` from either skill page below into your agent's skills directory. Your agent already knows how to discover and use it.
