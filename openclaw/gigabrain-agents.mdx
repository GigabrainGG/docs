### Agent CRUD

#### POST /v1/agents - Create Agent
Create a new trading agent. Costs $0.20 in credits. Agent is created disabled by default.

```json
{
  "name": "string (required) - display name",
  "goal": "string (required) - trading goal, e.g. 'Monitor ETH/USDT and go long when RSI drops below 30'",
  "instructions": "string (required) - detailed strategy, behavior, and risk parameters",
  "triggers": [
    {
      "type": "scheduled",
      "cron": "*/15 * * * *"
    },
    {
      "type": "alpha",
      "match": "ETH momentum breakouts and trend reversals",
      "min_impact_rating": 3
    }
  ],
  "memory_enabled": true,
  "trading_enabled": false,
  "model": "default",
  "enabled": false
}
```

**Trigger types:**
- `scheduled` - cron-based. Supported: `*/5 * * * *` (5min), `*/15 * * * *` (15min), `0 * * * *` (hourly), `0 */4 * * *` (4h), `0 0 * * *` (daily). Minimum 5 minutes.
- `alpha` - signal-based. The `match` string is vector-matched against incoming alpha signals. `min_impact_rating` (1-5, default 3): 1-2 = low impact, 3 = moderate, 4 = high, 5 = critical.

#### GET /v1/agents - List Agents
List all agents owned by the authenticated user.
Query params: `limit` (integer, default 50)

#### GET /v1/agents/{agent_id} - Get Agent
Get details of a specific agent including configuration, triggers, stats, and status.

#### PATCH /v1/agents/{agent_id} - Update Agent
Update an agent's name, description, goal, or instructions. Only provided fields are updated.

```json
{
  "name": "optional new name",
  "description": "optional new description",
  "goal": "optional new goal",
  "instructions": "optional new instructions"
}
```

#### DELETE /v1/agents/{agent_id} - Delete Agent
Permanently delete an agent and all its data.
**WARNING: Export wallet keys and withdraw funds BEFORE deleting. This is irreversible.**

### Agent Lifecycle

#### POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/enable - Enable Agent
Start the agent. It will begin executing on its configured triggers. Trading agents require a wallet to be generated and activated first.

#### POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/disable - Disable Agent
Stop the agent. All trigger-based execution pauses. Configuration and history are preserved.

### Wallet Management

#### POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/wallet - Generate Wallet
Generate a trading wallet for the agent. Returns the existing wallet if one has already been generated. Required before enabling a trading agent.

#### GET /v1/agents/{agent_id}/wallet - Get Wallet
Get wallet details including address, chain type, exchange, and status.

#### POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/wallet/activate - Activate Wallet
Activate the wallet for live trading. The wallet must be funded first. Returns an error with deposit address if balance is insufficient.

#### POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/wallet/send - Send Funds
Send funds from the agent's wallet to a destination address.

```json
{
  "destination": "0x... wallet address",
  "amount": 100.0
}
```

### Chat

#### POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/chat - Chat with Agent
Send a message to an agent and get a response. Requires credits.

```json
{
  "message": "What positions are you currently monitoring?",
  "session_id": "optional - omit to start new session",
  "stream": false
}
```

### Monitoring

#### GET /v1/agents/{agent_id}/runs - Agent Runs
Get execution history for a specific agent, including trigger type, status, summary, reasoning, and whether an action was taken.
Query params: `limit` (integer, default 50)

### Strategy Suggestions

#### POST /v1/agents/suggest - Suggest Strategy
Get AI-generated trading strategy suggestions based on market context. Rate limited to 10 requests per hour.

```json
{
  "context": {
    "asset": "ETH",
    "style": "momentum",
    "risk_tolerance": "moderate",
    "timeframe": "4H"
  }
}
```

The `context` field is a free-form JSON object. Pass any key-value pairs for market context, preferences, or constraints. The body is optional.

## Rate Limits

- 60 requests per minute
- Strategy suggestions: 10 per hour
- Monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Minute` header
- On 429 response: wait `Retry-After` seconds before retrying

## Agent Lifecycle Flow

The typical flow for creating and launching a trading agent:

1. **Create** - `POST /v1/agents` with name, goal, instructions, triggers
2. **Generate wallet** - `POST /v1/agents/{id}/wallet`
3. **Fund wallet** - Send USDC to the wallet address from `GET /v1/agents/{id}/wallet`
4. **Activate wallet** - `POST /v1/agents/{id}/wallet/activate`
5. **Enable agent** - `POST /v1/agents/{id}/enable`
6. **Monitor** - `GET /v1/agents/{id}/runs` to check execution history

To safely shut down:
1. **Disable** - `POST /v1/agents/{id}/disable`
2. **Export keys** - Export private key from the Gigabrain UI (Profile → Agents → Export Key)
3. **Withdraw funds** - `POST /v1/agents/{id}/wallet/send`
4. **Delete** - `DELETE /v1/agents/{id}`

## Error Handling

- 401: Invalid or revoked API key - verify at https://gigabrain.gg/profile?tab=api
- 404: Agent not found - check the agent_id
- 429: Rate limit exceeded - wait `Retry-After` seconds
- 500/503: Server error - retry with exponential backoff

## Important Notes

- Agents are created disabled by default - call enable after wallet setup
- Trading agents MUST have a generated and activated wallet before enabling
- ALWAYS export wallet keys and withdraw funds before deleting an agent. Deletion is permanent and funds are irrecoverable
- Each agent gets its own dedicated Hyperliquid wallet
- Agent creation costs $0.20 in credits; chat and runs also consume credits

## Example Workflows

### Create and Launch a Trading Agent

```
Create a Gigabrain trading agent called "ETH Momentum Bot" that monitors
ETH/USDT and goes long when RSI drops below 30 on the 4H chart. Use a
scheduled trigger every 15 minutes. Enable trading and set up the wallet.
```

The agent will handle the full lifecycle: create the agent, generate a wallet, tell you the address to fund, then activate and enable once funded.

### Safe Agent Shutdown

```
Safely shut down my agent "ETH Momentum Bot". Disable it, export the
wallet keys, withdraw all funds to 0xYourAddress, then delete it.
```

<Warning>
  **Always export wallet keys and withdraw funds before deleting an agent.** Deletion is permanent and any funds remaining in the agent's wallet will be irrecoverable.
</Warning>
