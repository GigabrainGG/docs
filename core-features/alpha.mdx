Alpha in Gigabrain is a way to get important market stories and insights that can really move prices. It pulls from smart searches, news about specific cryptocurrencies (like big investor buys or new rules), and recent events to highlight key indicators: think whale activity, regulations, or shifts in sectors like DeFi or AI.

Unlike just reading raw headlines from news sites or aggregators, Alpha combines this info with fresh data (like current prices) to give you clear, practical summaries. This helps you spot trading opportunities early, before everyone else jumps in. It's like having a quick briefing from a team of analysts who connect the dots, saving you hours of scrolling through unrelated noise.

## Why Use Alpha?

- **Spot Hidden Edges**: It uncovers narratives that aren't obvious, such as a whale quietly building a position in a low-cap token or a regulatory rumor gaining traction.
- **Time Saver**: Instead of manual research, get synthesized overviews with context, like how a Fed announcement might ripple through crypto.
- **Actionable Focus**: Every insight includes an "impact rating" (low to high) and ties to real-time data, so you can decide if it's worth digging deeper.
- **Tailored to Crypto**: Optimized for markets like BTC/ETH trends, protocol launches, or meme coin hype, with cross-checks for accuracy.
