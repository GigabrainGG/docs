## How it works

### Information sources

Alpha continuously ingests data from:

1. **Crypto native news**: Protocol blogs, governance forums, official announcements
2. **Traditional financial media**: Fed statements, regulatory filings, macro developments
3. **Onchain indexers**: Whale wallet tracking, exchange inflows/outflows, gas consumption
4. **Social platforms**: Twitter/X activity, Telegram signals, Discord announcements
5. **Prediction markets**: Polymarket odds, event probabilities
6. **Macro indicators**: VIX, DXY (Dollar Strength), Treasury Yields for risk regime classification

### Synthesis process

Raw information is filtered and analyzed to:

- **Identify catalysts**: Events likely to drive price action (token unlocks, partnerships)
- **Detect early narratives**: Emerging themes before mainstream attention (sector rotation to AI tokens)
- **Flag anomalies**: Z-score anomalies (metrics 2+ standard deviations from 30-day mean) indicating statistically significant moves
- **Cross reference sources**: Verify information across channels to reduce false signals
- **Classify risk regime**: Determine if market is Risk-On, Risk-Off, or Neutral based on macro volatility
- **Detect squeeze setups**: Identify liquidation clusters where price is likely to be pulled to trigger stops

### Insight format

Each Alpha card displays:

- **Headline**: Concise summary of the key development
- **Analysis**: Expandable section with market context, directional bias, and timing considerations
- **Invalidation criteria**: For high-impact insights, the specific price or event that nullifies the thesis
- **Tags**: Sentiment (BULLISH ↗ / BEARISH ↘), Impact level, Category, Timestamp
- **Actions**: Star to bookmark, "Suggest Trade" button for trade ideas

### Suggest Trade

Each insight includes a **Suggest Trade** button that:

1. Analyzes the specific insight and current market conditions
2. Generates concrete trade ideas with entry criteria, position sizing, and exit rules
3. Can be used to manually execute trades or configure an Agent to act on similar signals automatically
