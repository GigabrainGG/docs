![Chat Response Example](/images/chat-response.png)

Gigabrain Chat is your conversational interface to The Brain, a team of specialized market analysts that work together to answer your questions in real-time. Instead of scrolling through charts, reading news, and checking onchain data separately, just ask a question and get a synthesized answer with a clear thesis, risk assessment, and invalidation points.

Chat pulls live data from prices, order books, funding rates, onchain metrics, news feeds, and social sentiment. It supports follow up questions with session memory, so you can refine your analysis like you're having a conversation with a trading desk.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Routes to specialists">
    Your query is sent to the right analysts (Macro, Microstructure,
    Fundamentals, Price Action, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetches live data">
    Pulls current prices, funding rates, whale activity, protocol metrics, and
    news
  </Step>
  <Step title="Synthesizes insights">
    Combines all the data into a clear answer with a verdict, setup, and trade
    idea
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maintains context">
    Remembers your conversation so you can ask follow ups without repeating
    yourself
  </Step>
</Steps>

You don't need to know which specialist to ask the system figures it out automatically.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be specific" icon="bullseye">
    **Vague:** "Tell me about crypto"  
    **Better:** "Analyze BTC on the 4H chart. Is this a continuation or reversal setup?"
  </Card>

<Card title="Include timeframes" icon="clock">
  **5m-15m** - Scalping **1H-4H** - Intraday/swing **1D-1W** - Position trading
</Card>

<Card title="Ask for multiple angles" icon="layer-group">
  "Analyze SOL: fundamentals + technicals + microstructure" When all three
  align, you have a stronger edge.
</Card>

<Card title="Pre-trade checks" icon="shield-check">
  "ETH long at $2,050. Check for major resistance nearby, funding rate extremes,
  and upcoming macro events"
</Card>

<Card title="Follow up to go deeper" icon="comments">
  - "Elaborate on the invalidation level" - "What historical precedent supports
  this?" - "How does this compare to last FOMC?"
</Card>

  <Card title="Time it right" icon="calendar">
    Most useful during market hours, before major events (CPI, FOMC), or when you need a quick read on current conditions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What Chat is (and isn't)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What it does">
    ✓ Analyzes current market conditions across price, fundamentals, macro, and positioning  
    ✓ Provides clear theses with entry, target, and invalidation levels  
    ✓ Synthesizes data from multiple sources into one coherent view  
    ✓ Maintains conversation context for iterative follow ups  
    ✓ Pulls live data so analysis reflects current state  
    ✓ Executes trades directly when your exchange is connected
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="What it doesn't do">
    ✗ Make trading decisions for you (it provides analysis, you decide whether to trade)  
    ✗ Predict the future with certainty (it analyzes current data and patterns)  
    ✗ Replace your own judgment (it's a tool to inform decisions, not make them)  
    ✗ Cover non-crypto markets in depth (focus is crypto with macro context)
