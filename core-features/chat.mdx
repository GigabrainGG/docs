## Best Practices for Using Gigabrain Chat

Gigabrain is built for sharp, data driven crypto market intel think real-time analysis, specialist breakdowns, and alpha hunting. Treat it like consulting a team of traders, not a general AI. Here's how to get the most value:

1. **Be Specific and Actionable**: Frame questions around decisions, like "What's the edge on SOL long here?" or "Break down ETH fundamentals post-Dencun." Vague asks like "Tell me about crypto" get generic responses; tie to timeframes, tokens, or events for depth.

2. **Leverage the Specialist Team**: Mention what you need (e.g., "Macro view on BTC" or "Microstructure for UNI perps") to route to the right agent. We handle macro regimes, token fundamentals, price action, low cap narratives, and Polymarket odds.

3. **Iterate on Responses**: Follow up on key points, like "Elaborate on the invalidation level" or "Compare to last FOMC." This builds a conversation without restarting.

4. **Combine Angles**: Ask for multi faceted views, e.g., "Fundamentals + technicals on ARB." We cross validate indicators for conviction.

5. **Time It Right**: Use for pre trade checks or event previews (CPI, unlocks). Responses pull live data, so they're freshest during market hours.
