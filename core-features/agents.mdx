description: Autonomous trading with dedicated Hyperliquid wallets
---

Agents are autonomous programs that execute trading strategies on your behalf. Each agent runs on a configurable schedule, analyzes market conditions using The Brain, and executes trades on its own dedicated Hyperliquid wallet.

## Overview

An agent consists of five components:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Instructions" icon="list-check">
    The rules that define when and how your agent trades

  <Card title="Goal" icon="bullseye">
    Your strategic objective and risk parameters

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How agents work

### Execution cycle

Every time your agent's trigger fires, it follows this sequence:

1. **Query current state**: Retrieve wallet balance, open positions, and recent performance
2. **Consult memory**: Review past trades under similar conditions from the Learnings database
3. **Analyze market conditions**: Delegate to relevant specialists (Macro, Microstructure, Price Movement, etc.)
4. **Evaluate instructions**: Determine whether entry, exit, or risk management criteria are satisfied, informed by both current analysis and historical outcomes
5. **Execute actions**: Place orders, modify positions, or do nothing based on evaluation
6. **Record outcome**: Log the reasoning, actions taken, and market state to the Learnings database for future reference

### Dedicated wallets

Each agent gets its own Hyperliquid wallet. This keeps your agents isolated from each other and from your personal funds. The flow is:

1. Create your agent
2. Generate a wallet for the agent
3. Fund the wallet with USDC
4. Activate the wallet
5. Enable the agent

<Warning>
Always export your agent's wallet private keys before deleting an agent. Deletion is permanent and any remaining funds in the wallet are irrecoverable. See the [Agent Setup Guide](/guides/agents-setup) for details.
</Warning>

### Memory and decision making

Unlike traditional bots that treat every market condition the same way, Gigabrain Agents build institutional knowledge from every trade. Before executing, your Agent reviews past trades under similar conditions, checking what worked, what didn't, and why.

**What gets recorded:**

- Trade outcomes relative to initial analysis
- Market conditions when trades succeeded or failed
- Patterns in profitable vs. unprofitable setups
- Strategy adjustments made over time

**How memory improves decisions:**

Before executing any trade, Agents consult their memory to review past performance under similar market conditions. For example, if your Agent took three losing trades during low-volume consolidation periods despite meeting all entry criteria, it will recognize this pattern and apply more caution when similar conditions appear again, potentially requiring stronger confirmation signals or skipping marginal setups entirely.

This memory doesn't automatically modify your Instructions, but it informs how the Agent interprets market conditions and applies your rules. Over time, this creates institutional knowledge specific to your strategy. The Agent develops "track record awareness" that improves execution quality without requiring manual backtesting or constant instruction updates.

## Configuration

### Instructions

Define your trading logic using natural language. Be explicit about entry criteria, position sizing, exit rules, and risk limits.

<Accordion title="View example instructions">
```
Monitor BTC and ETH on the 15m timeframe.

ENTRY CRITERIA:

- Price breaks above previous 4H high with volume >150% of 20-period average
- RSI(14) between 55-70 (momentum confirmed, not overbought)
- Funding rate <0.03% (avoiding overleveraged longs)
- Taker buy volume >55% over last 3 candles (aggressive buying)

FILTERS (DO NOT ENTER IF):

- VIX >30 (macro risk-off environment)
- Major resistance within 2% above entry
- Ongoing high-impact news event within next 2 hours

POSITION SIZING:

- Base size: 5% of account balance
- Leverage: 3x (15% notional exposure)
- Maximum 2 concurrent positions

EXIT RULES:

- Take profit: +6% from entry (trim 50%), +10% (close remaining)
- Stop loss: -3% from entry (hard stop)
- Time stop: Close after 48 hours if neither TP nor SL hit
- Trailing stop: Once +5%, trail stop at -2% from peak

RISK MANAGEMENT:

- Daily loss limit: -5% of account (halt all trading)
- Weekly profit target: +15% (reduce position sizes by 50%)
- Maximum 4 trades per day (prevent overtrading)

```
</Accordion>

<Note>
Instructions are interpreted by the agent's language model. Ambiguous phrasing may lead to unexpected behavior. Test new instructions with small position sizes.
</Note>

### Triggers

Choose how your agent decides when to run:

| Type | How it works | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Every 5 minutes | Runs on a fixed schedule | Scalping strategies |
| Every 15 minutes | Runs on a fixed schedule | Intraday momentum trading |
| Hourly | Runs on a fixed schedule | Swing trading setups |
| Every 4 hours | Runs on a fixed schedule | Position trading |
| Daily | Runs on a fixed schedule | Fundamental-based strategies |
| Alpha trigger | Runs when a matching signal is detected by the Alpha engine | Event-driven and signal-based strategies |

Alpha triggers use vector matching against incoming Alpha signals. The more specific your match string, the better the filtering. You can also set a minimum impact rating (1-5) to only trigger on high-conviction signals.

## Monitoring

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Reasoning">
    Each agent run generates a trace showing:
    - Current wallet state (balance, open positions, P&L)
    - Market analysis from consulted specialists
    - Evaluation of entry/exit criteria
    - Actions taken or reasons for inaction

    Use this to verify the agent interprets your instructions correctly.

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start conservative" icon="shield-check">
    Use small position sizes (1-5%), set tight stops, and monitor the first 10-20 reasoning traces closely before scaling up.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Iterate based on learnings" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Review the Learnings tab weekly to identify failure modes, optimal conditions, and opportunities to refine entry criteria.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use daily caps" icon="gauge-high">
    Set profit caps at 2-5% of wallet value to prevent overtrading and lock in gains.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Monitor macro regime" icon="earth-americas">
    Reduce position sizes during high VIX, avoid mean-reversion in trending Fed policy, pause during major geopolitical events.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Export keys regularly" icon="key">
    Back up your agent wallet's private keys. If you ever need to delete an agent, you'll need the keys to recover funds.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Review reasoning traces" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Regularly check traces to verify correct interpretation and identify edge cases in your strategy logic.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not executing trades">
    **Possible causes**:
    1. Agent is not enabled (check agent state is "Online")
    2. Wallet is not activated or funded
    3. Entry criteria are not being met (review reasoning traces)
    4. Daily cap has been reached (check recent P&L)
    5. Risk limit has been triggered (check wallet balance vs. floor)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unexpected trade execution">
    **Possible causes**:
    1. Instructions are ambiguous (refine phrasing and test again)
    2. Market conditions changed rapidly between trigger intervals
    3. Specialist data was stale or delayed
    4. Edge case not covered in your instructions

    Review the reasoning trace for the specific run to understand what triggered the trade.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance degradation">
    **Possible causes**:
    1. Market regime has shifted (e.g., trending to range-bound)
    2. Strategy has attracted attention (edge degradation)
    3. Position sizing is too large for current volatility
    4. Stop losses are too tight for current ATR

    Review learnings for patterns and adjust instructions accordingly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Execution latency">
    Agent actions are subject to trigger interval (minimum 5 minutes), API latency to Hyperliquid, order processing time, and network conditions. Do not use agents for strategies requiring sub-minute execution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Market conditions">
    Agents cannot predict unexpected events (exchange outages, liquidity crises), guarantee fills at expected prices during volatile markets, or prevent slippage on large orders in illiquid markets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model limitations">
    The language model may misinterpret ambiguous phrasing, cannot execute logic requiring external data not available through specialists, and has a knowledge cutoff. Review reasoning traces to verify correct interpretation.
  </Accordion>
