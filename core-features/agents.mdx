Agents are autonomous units that are powered by the [The Intelligence Collective](https://docs.gigabrain.gg/#the-intelligence-collective). Moving beyond static "workflows," these agents use a recursive feedback loop to analyze, execute, and most importantly learn from every market outcome.

### Adaptive Learning: The Feedback Loop

The core strength of an Agent is its ability to learn from its own "mistakes."

- **Outcome Monitoring**: Agents track entries against actual price action—identifying if a signal was overridden by macro volatility or a microstructure shift.
- **Strategy Refinement**: Every post-mortem updates the agent's internal **Learnings** database, refining how it weights different variables (e.g., favoring macro news over technical indicators during high-volatility events).
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Use the **Changelog** and **Learnings** tabs to audit how your agent is evolving its strategy over time.

### Agent Archetypes: What You Can Build

#### 1. The Adaptive Swing Trader (BTC Focus)

> _"Analyze 4H BTC chart, microstructure, and whale positioning every 4 hours. Place a trade with 10% margin once confidence exceeds 75%. Re-analyze open trades every 30 minutes and send a performance summary to Telegram."_

#### 2. The Alpha Sniper (Asset-Agnostic)

> _"Monitor the Intelligence Feed. When a high-conviction signal (Confidence >75%) is flagged for **any** supported token, instantly open a $100 position at 5x leverage on that specific asset."_

#### 3. The Protocol KPI Hunter (Fundamental)

> _"Monitor Hyperliquid protocol fees daily. If daily fees exceed $3M, open a long HYPE position with 10% account margin."_

#### 4. The Macro Guardian (Risk Mitigation)

> _"Monitor global news and the **Macro Analyst** for keywords like 'war', 'invasion', or 'geopolitical escalation'. If a high-impact macro shock is detected, immediately close 50% of all altcoin exposure and open an OCO hedge on BTC."_

### Specialist Delegation

Agents route tasks to specialized domain experts in real-time:

- **Macro Analyst**: Monitors global liquidity, Fed policy, and geopolitical shocks.
- **Market State Analyst**: Classifies the regime (Risk-On/Off) to define current strategy.
- **Microstructure Analyst**: Identifies liquidation clusters and funding skews.
- **Trenches Analyst**: Scours social sentiment for micro-cap tokens (Rank 500+).

### Intelligent Synthesis

Every run is delivered as a structured report featuring a **Convicted Thesis**, **Risk Assessment**, **Execution Details**, **Learnings**, and **Invalidation Points**.
