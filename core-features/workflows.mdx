Workflows enable automated, multi-step analysis by chaining agents, tools, and conditions turning one off queries into repeatable processes. It coordinates the Intelligence Collective (our team of specialized agents) for complex tasks like regime scans followed by token alerts, using delegation logic to parallelize data pulls. Ideal for routine monitoring or scenario simulations, Workflows output structured reports with synthesized insights, including theses, risks, and invalidations.

### Intelligent Synthesis

Outputs are delivered as structured reports featuring clear trading theses, risk assessments, and invalidation points. Every insight is grounded in our four analytical pillars: **Microstructure, Fundamentals, Technicals, and Macro**.

### Flexible Logic

What sets Workflows apart is their flexibility. They are not fixed strategies but customizable pipelines that blend AI reasoning with user defined rules. For example:

> _"If OI delta > X and funding skew is positive, then alert on regime shift."_

### Seamless Execution

Users can trigger automated executions on platforms like **Hyperliquid** (e.g., opening/closing positions) or run complex delta neutral setups across exchanges, such as hedging longs on one perpetual contract with shorts on another.
