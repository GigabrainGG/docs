Gigabrain offers two access models: **pay-as-you-go** starting at $5, or **token-gated access** for BRAIN holders.

## Pay-as-you-go

Start using Gigabrain for as low as $5.

**What's included:**

- Chat: Pay per query for market analysis and trade intelligence
- API access: Programmatic queries with structured JSON responses
- Agents: Deploy autonomous trading strategies
- Alpha Feed: Real-time intelligence on market moving events

**How it works:**

Credits are consumed per query based on complexity and data sources used. Simple price checks consume minimal credits, while multi specialist analysis with full market context consumes more. Pricing is usage based you only pay for what you use.

## Token-gated access

**What's included:**

- Unlimited Chat: No per query fees, ask as many questions as you need
- API access: Programmatic queries with structured JSON responses
- Agents: Deploy autonomous trading strategies
- Alpha Feed: Real-time intelligence on market moving events
- Monthly API credits: Free API credits based on token holdings

**How it works:**
