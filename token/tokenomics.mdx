description: "BRAIN Token Utility & Economics"
---

The BRAIN token is the core utility and value accrual mechanism of the Gigabrain ecosystem. Built on the Base blockchain with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 BRAIN tokens, it enables platform access and rewards token holders through multiple utility functions.

## Token Distribution
The BRAIN token supply is distributed with a focus on community ownership and long-term alignment:
- 85% Public Distribution
- 4.5% Team and Treasury
- 10.5% Future Growth

Team and Future Growth allocations are subject to vesting schedules to ensure long-term commitment to the project's success.

## Terminal Access – 1M BRAIN
Holding 1,000,000 BRAIN tokens in your wallet grants access to the full Gigabrain Terminal platform, including real-time market data, AI-powered trading signals, and advanced analytics tools.

## Gigabrain Alpha Fund – 1M BRAIN
Token holders with 1M BRAIN can participate in the AI-managed trading fund on Hyperliquid. This exclusive fund leverages Gigabrain's algorithmic trading engine to generate returns that are shared with participating token holders through staking rewards.

## Revenue Sharing
The platform implements a buyback mechanism where a portion of Gigabrain's profits is used to purchase BRAIN tokens from the market. This creates consistent buy pressure and ensures token holders benefit directly from the platform's success.

This token utility model creates strong alignment between platform success and token value, while ensuring the ecosystem remains community-driven through its fair distribution structure.
