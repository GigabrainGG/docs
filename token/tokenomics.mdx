The BRAIN token is the core utility and value accrual mechanism of the Gigabrain ecosystem. Built on the Base blockchain with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 BRAIN tokens, it enables platform access and rewards token holders through multiple utility functions.

## Token Distribution

The BRAIN token supply is distributed with a focus on community ownership and long-term alignment:

- 85% Public Distribution
- 4.5% Team and Treasury
- 10.5% Future Growth

Team and Future Growth allocations are subject to vesting schedules to ensure long-term commitment to the project's success.

## Token Utility

The \$BRAIN token powers Gigabrain’s premium features and trader incentives:

- Access to Auto-Trade and Vaults for holders with 1M\+ \$BRAIN
- Reduced trading fees (75% discount for 1M\+ \$BRAIN holders)
- Exclusive signal channels, macro briefings, and research reports

## Alignment

\$BRAIN demand grows with trader activity — the more the ecosystem trades, the deeper the token’s role in execution, research, and access.

## Buybacks

The platform implements a buyback mechanism where a portion of Gigabrain's profits is used to purchase BRAIN tokens from the market. This creates consistent buy pressure and ensures token holders benefit directly from the platform's success.

This token utility model creates strong alignment between platform success and token value, while ensuring the ecosystem remains community-driven through its fair distribution structure.
