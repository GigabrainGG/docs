## Revenue Sources

Gigabrain generates revenue through multiple streams:

### Investment Funds

Performance fees from multiple AI-managed funds:

- Additional specialized funds to be launched based on market demand and strategy validation
- Each fund targets specific trading strategies and risk profiles

### Terminal Access

Two-tiered access model:

- Token-based: Hold 1M BRAIN tokens (current model)
- USDC Subscriptions: Traders can access premium features via **USDC subscriptions**.\
  A portion of all USDC subscription revenue will be used for **\$BRAIN buybacks**, directly linking platform growth with token demand.\
  By tying real platform usage to token buy pressure, we keep \$BRAIN aligned with the ecosystemâ€™s success.

### Trading Fees

Gigabrain charges competitive rates with significant benefits for loyal token holders:

- **Base fee:** 0.10% per trade
- **1M\+ \$BRAIN holders:** 75% discount (effective fee: 0.025%)

  This structure rewards committed community members while keeping fees fair for all active traders.

Enterprise and institutional offerings:

- Direct API access to Gigabrain's intelligence engine
- Custom data feeds and analytics
- White-label solutions for trading platforms
- AI agent integration for automated trading systems

- Staking incentives for long-term token holders
