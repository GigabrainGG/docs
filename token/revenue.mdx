## Revenue Sources

Gigabrain generates revenue through multiple streams:

### Investment Funds
Performance fees from multiple AI-managed funds:
- Alpha Fund: 10% performance fee initially (planned increases in future phases)
- Additional specialized funds to be launched based on market demand and strategy validation
- Each fund targets specific trading strategies and risk profiles

### Terminal Access
Two-tiered access model:
- Token-based: Hold 1M BRAIN tokens (current model)
- USDC Subscriptions: To be introduced as token price appreciation makes token-based access cost-prohibitive
  - Tiered subscription plans with varying feature access
  - Enterprise plans for institutional clients
  - Custom solutions for high-volume traders

### Trading Fees
Revenue from direct trading execution (Subject to change):
- Base trading fee of 0.1% per trade
- Volume-based fee discounts for active traders
- Additional fees for advanced order types and features
- Integration with major DEXs and CEXs for seamless execution

### API & Data Services
Enterprise and institutional offerings:

## Revenue Allocation

Platform revenue follows a transparent allocation formula:

### Operational Expenses (50%)
- Team & talent
- Development & infrastructure 
- Marketing & growth

### Community Treasury (50%)
- **Token Buybacks**: 50% of community treasury
- **Community Rewards**: 50% of community treasury

The platform implements a systematic buyback program where a portion of profits is used to purchase BRAIN tokens from the market, creating consistent buy pressure and ensuring token holders directly benefit from Gigabrain's success.

## Community Rewards

Community rewards are distributed to active participants through:
- Staking incentives for long-term token holders
- Trading competitions with BRAIN token prizes
- Data contribution rewards for sharing alpha and market insights
- Bug bounties and platform improvement suggestions
- Community content creation and educational resources

<Note>
  The allocations are subject to change based on market conditions and platform growth. Staking rewards may be converted to additional token buybacks based on regulatory requirements.
