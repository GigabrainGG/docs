## Revenue Sources

Gigabrain generates revenue through multiple streams:

- **Alpha Fund**: 10% performance fee initially (planned increases in future phases)
- **USDC Subscriptions**: Alternative access option planned for future implementation
  - Specific tier details and pricing to be determined
- **API & Data Services**: Enterprise access and institutional offerings

## Revenue Allocation

Platform revenue follows a transparent allocation formula:
### Operational Expenses (30%)
- Team & talent
- Infrastructure 
- Marketing & growth

### Community Treasury (70%)
- **Token Buybacks**: 40% of treasury (28% of total revenue)
- **Development Fund**: 40% of treasury (28% of total revenue)
- **Staking Rewards**: 20% of treasury (14% of total revenue)

Regular buybacks create sustainable demand pressure for the token while staking rewards provide fund returns to long-term holders.
