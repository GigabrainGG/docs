## Overview

![Screenshot 2025-06-25 at 2.43.15 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-06-25at2.43.15PM.png)

Auto-Trade is a fully integrated, rules-based trading infrastructure designed to mirror curated strategies in real time. It supports both human-validated and agentic (AI-led) strategies and operates natively on Hyperliquid via proprietary Gigabrain infrastructure. The system ensures low-latency execution, proportional risk exposure, and zero manual intervention post-subscription.

## 1. System Architecture

### Strategy Categories

**1. Hybrid (Human \+ AI) Strategies**\
Trades are initiated by experienced strategists and passed through multiple layers of Gigabrain agentic validation before execution. These strategies benefit from human discretion reinforced by systematized signal intelligence.

**2. Fully Agentic Strategies**\
Completely autonomous execution. Trades are identified, validated, and executed by Gigabrain agents operating within predefined market logic, without human involvement.

### Copy Trading Engine

- Real-time replication of trades from strategy master accounts to user accounts
- Enforces strict execution timing and position parity
- Built for high-availability, concurrent load, and deterministic behavior

### Hyperliquid MCP Integration

- Direct native execution on Hyperliquid
- Ultra-low latency synchronization across user accounts
- MCP (Multi-Counterparty Protocol) compliance for institutional-grade throughput

## 2. Trade Execution Flow

1. **Signal Triggered**: A trading opportunity is identified by the strategy (either human-initiated or agentic).
2. **Master Account Execution**: Trade is executed on the strategy account.
3. **Trade Replication**: The Copy Engine mirrors this trade across all subscribed user accounts in real-time.
4. **State Sync**: Risk parameters (position size, TP/SL levels) are applied uniformly across all instances.

## 3. Capital Allocation & Risk Management

### Proportional Sizing

Each user’s trade size is a direct function of their allocated strategy capital. For instance, a \$1,000 subscription with a 10% per-trade allocation results in a ~\$100 notional per trade, regardless of their broader account balance on Hyperliquid.

### Risk Parameter Enforcement

- **Dynamic Stop Losses (SL)** and **Take Profits (TP)** are synchronized live from strategy parameters
- System supports mid-trade updates to risk profiles across all accounts
- All adjustments are atomic and timestamp-aligned

### Future: Risk Profile Customization

Upcoming functionality will allow users to select from risk modes per strategy:

- **Conservative** – Lower exposure and tighter risk limits
- **Balanced** – Default system parameters
- **Aggressive** – Expanded position sizing with higher risk tolerance

## 4. User Experience & Controls

- **Zero manual intervention** post-subscription
- Full visibility into live and historical trade activity via Hyperliquid
- Native support for unsubscription and capital reallocation

## 5. Glossary

**Copy Trading Engine**: Infrastructure layer that mirrors strategy trades to user accounts\
**Agentic Strategy**: Fully automated AI strategy executing without human involvement\
**TP / SL**: Take Profit / Stop Loss thresholds\
**MCP**: Hyperliquid’s execution protocol for multi-party trade synchronization\
**Position Netting**: Real-time adjustment of opposing positions to reflect net exposure
