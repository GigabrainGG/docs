## Overview

Auto-Trade is an automated trading solution that enables users to replicate trades from curated trading strategies in real-time. The system supports both human-verified and fully autonomous AI-driven strategies, ensuring seamless execution without manual intervention. Users can subscribe to strategies and automatically mirror all trading activities through our proprietary infrastructure.

## Strategy Categories

Auto-Trade operates with two distinct strategy types:

### 1. Human \+ AI Verification Strategies

These strategies combine human expertise with artificial intelligence validation. Experienced traders initiate positions, which are then verified and processed through Gigabrain's agents before execution.

### 2. Fully Agentic Strategies

These strategies operate entirely through AI agents, generating and executing trades based on predetermined parameters and market analysis algorithms without human intervention.

## Technical Infrastructure

The Auto-Trade system is built on custom, proprietary infrastructure designed for high-performance trading operations:\
\
**Copy Trading Engine**

- Efficiently replicates trades from master strategy accounts to subscriber accounts
- Ensures real-time synchronization across all connected accounts
- Maintains position accuracy and timing consistency

**Hyperliquid MCP Server**

- High-speed trade execution built on Hyperliquid's protocol
- Optimized for minimal latency and maximum reliability
- Public rollout scheduled for future release

## System Operations

### **Trade Execution Process**

1. **Initial Execution**: Strategy managers execute trades on the Hyperliquid platform
2. **Real-time Replication**: The Copy Trading Engine immediately mirrors the trade across all subscriber accounts
3. **Synchronization**: All positions are opened simultaneously to maintain strategy integrity

### **Position Sizing**

The system implements proportional sizing based on individual subscriber capital allocation. Each trade is scaled according to the percentage of capital the user has allocated to the specific strategy, ensuring appropriate risk management relative to account size.

### Risk Management

The platform provides continuous monitoring and adjustment of risk parameters:

- **Take Profit (TP) Management**: Real-time tracking and adjustment of profit-taking levels
- **Stop Loss (SL) Management**: Dynamic stop-loss updates based on strategy modifications
- **Parameter Updates**: Instant synchronization of risk parameter changes across all subscriber positions

## User Experience

The Auto-Trade system is designed for complete automation and transparency:

- **Zero Manual Input**: No user intervention required after initial subscription
- **Real-time Execution**: Immediate trade replication and position updates
- **Full Transparency**: All trading activity is visible within the user's Hyperliquid account
- **Account Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Hyperliquid accounts

## Upcoming Features

### Strategy Customization

Users will be able to select from multiple risk profiles for each strategy:

- Conservative: Lower risk tolerance with reduced position sizing
- Balanced: Standard risk parameters as defined by the strategy
- Aggressive: Enhanced risk tolerance with increased position sizing
