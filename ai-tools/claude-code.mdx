Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool. This guide will help you set up Claude Code to build integrations with Gigabrain's Intelligence Collective API.

## Prerequisites

- Active Claude subscription (Pro, Max, or API access)
- Gigabrain API key from your [Profile](https://gigabrain.gg/profile)

## Setup

1. Install Claude Code globally:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Add the `CLAUDE.md` file below to your project.
4. Run `claude` to start.

## Create `CLAUDE.md`

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your project to train Claude Code on Gigabrain's API:

````markdown
# Gigabrain Integration Project

## Working relationship

- You can push back on ideas - this leads to better code
- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- NEVER lie, guess, or make up information about the API

## Gigabrain API Context

### Base URL

```
https://api.gigabrain.gg/v1
```

### Authentication

```bash
Authorization: Bearer gb_sk_<your-key>
```

### Core Endpoint: POST /v1/chat

Send market analysis queries to the Intelligence Collective.

Request:

```json
{
  "message": "Analyze BTC price action",
  "stream": false
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "message": "Analysis response...",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601"
}
```

### Rate Limits

- 30 requests/minute
- 1,000 requests/day
- Handle 429 errors with exponential backoff

## Intelligence Collective Agents

The API routes queries to specialized agents:

- **Macro**: DXY, VIX, yields, liquidity, risk regimes
- **Microstructure**: OI, funding, liquidations, positioning
- **Fundamentals**: TVL, revenue, unlocks, protocol health
- **Price Movement**: Technical analysis, EMAs, support/resistance
- **Trenches**: Micro-caps, social sentiment, narratives
- **Polymarket**: Prediction market odds and analysis

## Code Standards

### Required Error Handling

- 401: Invalid API key - prompt user to check key
- 429: Rate limited - implement retry with backoff
- 500: Server error - retry up to 3 times

### Security

- Store API keys in environment variables
- Never commit keys to version control
- Log only first 10 chars of keys for debugging

## Git Workflow

- NEVER use --no-verify when committing
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Create feature branches for new integrations

## Do Not

- Hardcode API keys
- Make assumptions about undocumented endpoints
- Skip error handling for rate limits
