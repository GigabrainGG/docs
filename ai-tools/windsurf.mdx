Configure Windsurf's Cascade AI assistant to help you build integrations with Gigabrain's Intelligence Collective API for crypto market analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Windsurf editor installed
- Gigabrain API key from your [Profile](https://gigabrain.gg/profile)

## Workspace rules

Create workspace rules that provide Windsurf with context about Gigabrain's API.

Create `.windsurf/rules.md` in your project root:

# Gigabrain API Integration

## Project Context

This project integrates with Gigabrain's Intelligence Collective API for crypto market analysis and trading insights.

## API Reference

### Base URL

```
https://api.gigabrain.gg/v1
```

### Authentication

Include API key in every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer gb_sk_<your-key>
```

### Main Endpoint: POST /v1/chat

Query the Intelligence Collective for market analysis.

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.gigabrain.gg/v1/chat", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: "Analyze BTC 4H chart",
    stream: false,
  }),
});
```

### Rate Limits

- 30 requests per minute
- 1,000 requests per day
- Check `Retry-After` header on 429 responses

## Intelligence Collective

Queries are routed to specialized agents:

- **Macro Analyst**: Global economic regimes, DXY, VIX, yields
- **Microstructure Analyst**: OI, funding rates, liquidations
- **Fundamentals Analyst**: TVL, revenue, protocol metrics
- **Price Movement Analyst**: Technical analysis, key levels
- **Trenches Analyst**: Micro-cap tokens, social sentiment
- **Polymarket Analyst**: Prediction market analysis

## Code Standards

### Error Handling

Always handle:

- `401` - Invalid API key
- `429` - Rate limit (implement exponential backoff)
- `500` - Server error (retry logic)

### Security Best Practices

- Use environment variables for API keys
- Never expose keys in client-side code
- Rotate keys periodically

### Example Query Types

**Trading:**

- "What's the edge on SOL long here?"
- "Break down ETH fundamentals post-Dencun"

**Microstructure:**

- "Is OI spiking on ETH perps?"
- "Funding rates turning negative?"

**Macro:**

- "Fed pivot incoming, risk on for alts?"
- "Liquidity drying up, BTC pullback likely?"

## Quality Standards

- Test all API integrations thoroughly
- Implement proper retry logic
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Log session_id for debugging
