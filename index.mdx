Gigabrain is your AI trading desk for crypto. It has two core products: **Gigabrain Intel** for market intelligence and **Gigabrain Agents** for autonomous trading.

## Gigabrain Intel

Intel is the research side. Ask any question about crypto markets and get a real-time answer backed by live data. No more flipping between ten tabs. Just ask and get the analysis a professional trader would spend hours putting together.

Behind every query is **The Brain** — it pulls live data across macro, positioning, fundamentals, technicals, and sentiment, then synthesizes everything into one coherent answer. You don't need to specify what data to fetch. The Brain figures it out.

Intel also powers the [Alpha Feed](/core-features/alpha), which monitors news, onchain activity, social signals, and market microstructure 24/7 to surface actionable insights before they reach mainstream awareness.

### What You Can Query

The Brain gives you access to 30+ data categories:

| Category | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **Market Data** | Token prices, funding rates, open interest, liquidations, order book depth |
| **Onchain** | TVL, protocol revenue, DEX volumes, whale activity, exchange flows, bridge flows |
| **Macro** | ETF flows, options data, mining data, macro events calendar, correlations |
| **Derivatives** | Short squeeze candidates, perp DEX rankings, top gainers/losers |
| **Research** | Yield opportunities, token unlocks, L2 metrics, NFT collections, relative strength |
| **Sentiment** | Fear & Greed, narrative tracking, Polymarket predictions, portfolio analysis |

All data types support **structured JSON responses** when you ask for it. Add "Respond as JSON" to your query. See the [Brain API Overview](/developers/brain-api-overview) for the full reference.

## Gigabrain Agents

Agents are the execution side. They are autonomous trading programs that use The Brain to analyze markets and execute trades on your behalf, 24/7.

Each agent gets its own dedicated **Hyperliquid wallet**. You define the strategy (when to enter, how much to risk, when to exit), fund the wallet, and the agent handles the rest. It monitors markets on a schedule you set, analyzes conditions using The Brain, and trades when your criteria are met.
