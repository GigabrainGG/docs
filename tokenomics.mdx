The BRAIN token is the core of the Gigabrain ecosystem, designed to align the platform's value with its community of users. Rather than a traditional subscription, Gigabrain uses a token-based model: holding BRAIN tokens unlocks platform access and various exclusive benefits. Key aspects of the token utility include:

## Terminal Access – 1M BRAIN
Holding at least 1,000,000 BRAIN tokens in your wallet is required to access the Gigabrain Terminal's full suite of premium features. This token threshold serves as your membership pass, immediately unlocking real-time market data, AI signals, and advanced trading tools.

## Gigabrain Alpha Fund – 1M BRAIN
In addition to the analytics platform, Gigabrain offers an AI-managed investment fund exclusively for token holders. With 1M BRAIN, you can choose to participate in this fund, letting you co-invest with an algorithmic trading engine powered by Gigabrain's insights. It's a way to capitalize on the platform's AI capabilities hands-free, with professional-grade risk management in place.

## Revenue Sharing
All BRAIN holders benefit from the growth of the Gigabrain platform through a built-in revenue sharing mechanism. A portion of platform fees and profits is funneled back to token holders as passive rewards, aligning incentives between Gigabrain and its community.

## Elite Community & Insights – 1M BRAIN
Holding 1M BRAIN also grants entry to Gigabrain's elite trading community. Token holders at this level join private channels for direct communication with the Gigabrain team and top-tier traders, gaining access to trading ideas and occasional exclusive insights.

Gigabrain's tokenomics reflect fairness and long-term commitment, with 85% of the BRAIN supply distributed to the community at launch and the team's share locked in multi-year vesting. There was no venture capital pre-allocation, reinforcing that Gigabrain is community-driven from day one.
