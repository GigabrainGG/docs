**Last Updated**: January 24, 2026

1. **Introduction**

These Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”) constitute a binding agreement between you (hereinafter referred to as “**you**”, “**your**”, or “**user**”) and Brain Labs Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (together with its affiliates, subsidiaries and any related entities, “**Gigabrain**”, “**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**”). 

These Terms govern your access to and use of our website available at [https://gigabrain.gg/](https://gigabrain.gg/), any sub-domains, mobile applications, terminals, dashboards, APIs, software, community channels and other products and services we make available now or in the future, including any features described as chat interface, alpha feed, research and monitoring features, token-gated features, third party integrations, reasoning, market intelligence feeds, event intelligence, alerts, workflows, and automation tasks (collectively, the “**Platform**” or “**Services**”). 

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE PLATFORM. THESE TERMS CONSTITUTE A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND GIGABRAIN AND GOVERN YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE PLATFORM AND ALL RELATED SERVICES PROVIDED BY GIGABRAIN.

BY ACCESSING OR USING THE PLATFORM, OR ANY PART THEREOF, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM. GIGABRAIN WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM AND THE SERVICES ONLY IF YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS IN FULL.

If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a company, organization, partnership, foundation or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms. In such cases, references to “you” or “your” shall be deemed to refer to such entity and its authorized representatives. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not accept all of these Terms on behalf of the entity, you must not access or use the Platform. Nothing in these Terms creates any agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or fiduciary relationship between you and Gigabrain, unless expressly set forth in a separate written agreement executed between you and Gigabrain. 

2. **Interpretation**

   2.1. Headings, titles, captions and section labels are included for convenience only and do not affect the interpretation of any provision. 

   2.2. Words and expressions defined in any part of these Terms shall have the same meaning throughout the document unless expressly stated otherwise or unless the context requires a different interpretation. Defined terms may be used in singular or plural form and capitalised for convenience, however, failure to capitalise a defined term shall not affect its intended meaning.

   2.3. These Terms incorporate by reference the Platform's [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy), [Risk Disclosure Statement](/support/risk-disclosure), and any additional terms or notices published by Gigabrain from time to time. All such incorporated documents shall be read together with these Terms and shall form part of the legally binding agreement between you and Gigabrain. In the event of inconsistency between these Terms and any incorporated document, these Terms shall prevail unless expressly stated otherwise.

   2.4. The words “include,” “includes,” “including,” “such as,” “for example,” and similar expressions shall be interpreted as illustrative and shall not limit the meaning of the words preceding them. Any examples are provided for clarity only and shall not be construed as exhaustive.

   2.5. References to any “person” or “entity” include individuals, corporations, partnerships, trusts, foundations, joint ventures, unincorporated associations, government bodies and any other legal or non-legal entities of any kind.

3. **Eligibility** 

   3.1. To access or use the Services, you must: (a) be at least 18 (eighteen) years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher; (b) have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms; and (c) not be prohibited from accessing or using the Services under applicable laws, sanctions regimes, or contractual restrictions applicable to Gigabrain or its third party service providers.

   3.2. You represent and warrant that you are not: (a) a person or entity subject to sanctions, embargoes, or restrictive measures administered or enforced by any applicable governmental authority; (b) accessing or using the Services on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any prohibited or restricted person or entity; or (c) using any technical measures, including VPNs, proxies, or similar tools, for the purpose of circumventing access restrictions or safeguards applied by Gigabrain or its third party integrations.
   
   3.3. Gigabrain may restrict, suspend, or terminate access to the Services where required to comply with applicable law, sanctions obligations, contractual requirements, or to protect the security and integrity of the Services.

4. **Nature of the Services**  

   4.1. Gigabrain provides market intelligence, analytics, and AI-assisted research tools designed to help users analyse cryptocurrency markets. The Services may include commentary, explanations, scenario analysis, event-driven intelligence and structured research outputs (which may include risk framing such as illustrative levels, ranges, or contingencies) and may present information from multiple sources, including market structure, on-chain activity, macro data, and other indicators. For clarity, Gigabrain does not provide ‘signals’ or guaranteed price targets, and does not provide personalized trading advice, recommendations, or instructions to trade. Any illustrative levels, ranges, scenarios, or contingencies are provided solely as general research context and may not be suitable for your circumstances.

   4.2. Gigabrain does not provide financial, investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice, and nothing in the Services constitutes a recommendation, endorsement, solicitation, or offer to buy or sell any asset or to enter into any transaction. All decisions to trade or invest are yours alone, and you use the Services at your own risk. The Services do not operate as an exchange, broker, dealer, custodian, clearinghouse, or settlement system, and Gigabrain does not hold, control, or custody user funds or digital assets at any time. Any functionality that allows you to transmit user-configured instructions to a third party venue is provided solely as a technical integration. All transactions occur on third party platforms, under the terms and conditions of those third parties. Gigabrain does not receive, hold, custody, control, transmit, exchange, convert, or settle fiat currency or digital assets on your behalf, and Gigabrain cannot initiate withdrawals or transfers of your assets.

   4.3. The Services may utilize automated systems, including artificial intelligence and algorithmic processes, to generate outputs such as commentary, analysis, summaries, classifications, or structured responses. These outputs are generated based on patterns, data inputs, and probabilistic models, and may contain errors, omissions, outdated information, or incomplete analysis. You acknowledge that AI-generated outputs are inherently uncertain and should not be relied upon as a substitute for independent judgment or professional advice. Gigabrain does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any output and disclaims responsibility for decisions made in reliance on such outputs.

   4.4. You acknowledge that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and risky. You may lose all or part of the funds you deploy in any trading or investment activity. Past performance, back-tests, sample results, or stated accuracy rates do not guarantee future results.

5. **Access and Wallet Connection** 

   5.1. Access to the Services may require connecting a compatible web3 wallet or other authentication mechanism made available by Gigabrain. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your authentication method and for all activity conducted through your account or connected wallet(s). You must notify us at [support@gigabrain.gg](mailto:support@gigabrain.gg) if you suspect unauthorized access or misuse.

   5.2. Gigabrain does not control your wallet provider, wallet software, or private keys. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet, private keys, seed phrase, and recovery phrase. You must never share your seed phrase or recovery phrase with Gigabrain or submit it through the Services.

6. **Token-Gated Access** 

   6.1. Certain features of the Services may be “token-gated”, meaning, access depends on holding a specified token or meeting an on-chain eligibility threshold. Where token-gated access applies, you authorize Gigabrain to verify eligibility by checking the relevant wallet address and associated on-chain data. Eligibility checks may be performed periodically to confirm continued access. If you no longer meet the eligibility threshold, you may lose access to token-gated features and, where applicable, the Services as a whole. The $BRAIN token is used solely as a mechanism to determine access, eligibility, or benefits within the Services, and does not represent an ownership interest in Gigabrain, a right to profits or revenues, or any form of investment contract. Token-gated access is a technical gating mechanism only and does not entitle you to any service continuity, revenues, buybacks, distributions, or economic benefits from Gigabrain.

   6.2. You acknowledge that token holdings can change at any time, and eligibility may be affected by transfers, sales, custody arrangements, smart wallet structures, or other on-chain activity. Gigabrain is not responsible for eligibility issues caused by your wallet configuration, token custody arrangements, or third party wallet limitations.

   6.3. Any reference to tokens, token holdings, or token-gated access relates solely to eligibility for certain features or benefits within the Services. Gigabrain does not guarantee the value, liquidity, availability, or future utility of any token, and makes no representations regarding token price, market performance, or secondary market activity. Gigabrain reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue token-gated features or eligibility thresholds at any time.

7. **Subscriptions & Billing** 

   7.1. Some Services may be offered on a subscription basis or for a fee. If you purchase a subscription or paid access, you agree to pay all applicable fees and charges associated with your plan, including any taxes or network fees where relevant. Billing may be processed through third party payment providers. Gigabrain typically receives limited transaction metadata such as payment status, timestamps, tier, or identifiers, and does not necessarily receive full payment instrument details.

   7.2. Unless otherwise stated at checkout, subscriptions may renew automatically at the end of the applicable term. You may cancel in accordance with the cancellation method provided in the Services. Cancelling stops future renewals but does not retroactively refund fees already paid for a current billing period, unless required by applicable law or explicitly offered by Gigabrain in writing. We may change pricing, features, or plan structures from time to time. If changes apply to an existing subscription, we will provide notice through the Services or via other reasonable means.

   7.3. Additional fees imposed by third party platforms, may apply where indicated in the Services. Gigabrain does not charge fees based on your trading performance.

8. **Third Party Integrations** 

    8.1. The Services may allow you to connect third party trading venues or protocols and transmit user-configured instructions to such third parties. For example, the Services may support integration with Hyperliquid. Any such functionality is user-directed, and Gigabrain does not decide whether, when, or how to trade. The Services may relay user-authorized instructions to third party venues, only as per the configurations you set and authorize.

    8.2. You understand and agree that: (a) all transactions occur on third party platforms under their terms and rules; (b) Gigabrain does not operate, custody, or control any third party platform, including Hyperliquid; and (c) Gigabrain is not responsible for the performance, availability, security, or acts/omissions of such third party platforms, including Hyperliquid; and (d) Gigabrain is not a party to any transaction you enter into on a third party platform, including Hyperliquid. Gigabrain does not act as a money services business or money transmitter and does not intermediate, settle, or clear transactions. Execution outcomes may differ from information displayed in the Services due to latency, slippage, liquidity conditions, partial fills, exchange rules, downtime, network congestion, or other factors outside Gigabrain’s control. You acknowledge that Gigabrain does not independently evaluate the suitability, risk, or appropriateness of any configured action and does not assume responsibility for outcomes resulting from your configurations.

    8.3. If you choose to connect third party platforms, you may provide credentials (such as API keys or agent keys) through an integration flow. You remain solely responsible for: (a) creating such credentials with the third party; (b) setting appropriate permissions; (c) securely storing and managing the credentials; and (d) rotating or revoking any credentials at any time.  Gigabrain does not assume responsibility for unauthorized access resulting from compromised credentials.

    8.4. If the Services offer automation features (for example, workflows or rules you configure), such automation only transmits instructions according to parameters you set. You are solely responsible for reviewing, monitoring, enabling, disabling, and updating any automation you configure. Gigabrain does not assess suitability, does not tailor automation to your circumstances, and does not guarantee any outcome.

    8.5. Gigabrain does not pool user assets, does not operate collective investment programs, and does not accept deposits. Any participation in third party programs occurs directly with the third party and under its rules.

9. **Platform Controls**

   9.1. Gigabrain reserves the right, but does not assume any obligation, to monitor, administer, and control access to the Services in order to maintain their integrity, security, and proper functioning. This includes: (a) the right to modify, limit, suspend, or discontinue any feature, output, workflow, automation, or integration; (b) to impose rate limits or usage caps; (c) to investigate suspected misuse or violations of these Terms; and (d) to take reasonable actions necessary to comply with applicable law, contractual obligations, or technical constraints imposed by third party service providers. 

   9.2. You acknowledge that Gigabrain may exercise these rights without prior notice and that such actions may affect your access to certain features or outputs. Gigabrain will not be liable for any losses or impacts resulting from the exercise of these rights, except as required by applicable law.

10. **User Content** 

    10.1. You may submit content to the Services, including prompts, queries, research requests, configuration inputs, workflow parameters, feedback, and support communications (“**User Content**”). As between you and Gigabrain, you retain any rights you may have in your User Content, subject to the license granted below.

    10.2. By submitting User Content, you grant Gigabrain a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license to host, store, process, reproduce, adapt, analyze, and display such User Content solely for the purposes of providing, maintaining, operating, improving, and securing the Services, enforcing these Terms, and complying with legal obligations, as further described in the Privacy Policy.

    10.3. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to submit User Content and that such content does not violate any law or third party rights. Gigabrain does not endorse and is not responsible for User Content, and reserves the right to remove or restrict access to User Content that violates these Terms or poses risk to the Services or other users.

11. **User Representations & Prohibited Conduct**

    11.1. You represent and warrant that: (a) you have the legal capacity and authority to enter into these Terms; (b) any wallet, account, or integration you connect to the Services is owned or controlled by you, or you are otherwise duly authorized to use it; (c) you understand and accept the risks associated with digital assets, trading, and automated or AI-assisted tools; (d) you are solely responsible for all decisions, configurations, and actions you take using the Services; (e) your use of the Services complies with applicable law and does not infringe any third party rights; and (f) any information or User Content you provide is accurate and not misleading. You acknowledge and agree that any token-based eligibility or access to the Services does not create any expectation of profit, appreciation, or financial return, and that you do not acquire or hold any token in reliance on the Services. You further acknowledge that Gigabrain does not provide personalized advice and that you will not use the Services as a substitute for independent analysis or professional advice.

    11.2. You agree not to misuse the Services or assist others in doing so. Prohibited conduct includes, without limitation: (a) using the Services for unlawful, deceptive, or fraudulent purposes; (b) attempting to reverse engineer, extract, scrape, or replicate the Services, models, outputs, or underlying methodologies; (c) generating excessive automated requests or traffic that degrades performance; (d) manipulating inputs or outputs to distort signals or mislead others; (e) using the Services to develop or operate competing products or services; (f) interfering with or bypassing access controls, safeguards, or usage limits; or (g) using the Services in a manner that harms Gigabrain, its users, or third parties.

    11.3. You shall not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services, probe or scan for vulnerabilities, or harvest data at scale without permission, or use the Services to transmit malware or abusive content. You further agree not to misuse the Services in a manner that interferes with their operation, integrity, or availability. This includes, without limitation, submitting abusive inputs, or using the Services to facilitate unlawful, deceptive, or harmful activity. 

    11.4. Gigabrain may implement rate limits, access controls, monitoring, or other safeguards and may suspend or terminate access where it reasonably determines that such measures are necessary to protect the Services, users, or third parties.

12. **Intellectual Property**

    12.1. The Services, including all software, algorithms, AI models (to the extent owned or licensed by Gigabrain), interfaces, designs, text, graphics, data compilations, feeds, workflows, outputs, and other materials made available through the Services (excluding User Content), are the exclusive property of Gigabrain or its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws.

    12.2. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Gigabrain grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Services solely for your personal or internal business purposes and only as permitted by the Services. You may not copy, reproduce, modify, distribute, resell, sublicense, reverse engineer, extract, scrape, or create derivative works from the Services or any portion thereof without Gigabrain’s prior written consent.

    12.3. Nothing in these Terms grants you any ownership rights in the Services, including in any AI-generated outputs, methodologies, or presentation formats, other than the limited license expressly granted herein.

13. **Third Party Services** 

    13.1. The Services may integrate, link to, or display content from third parties, including trading venues, market data providers, blockchain networks, social platforms, and community channels. Third party services are governed by their own terms and policies, and you are responsible for reviewing and complying with them. Gigabrain does not endorse and is not responsible for third party services, content, or availability. You are solely responsible for determining whether your use of any third party platform complies with applicable laws in your jurisdiction.

    13.2. The Services may allow you to connect third party messaging or community platforms, such as Telegram or X (formerly, Twitter), for purposes including notifications, updates, or administration of gated access. Use of such platforms is optional and governed by their own terms and policies. Gigabrain does not control and is not responsible for the availability, delivery, security, or content of communications transmitted through third party messaging services.

14. **Service Availability** 

    14.1. Gigabrain may modify, update, suspend, or discontinue any portion of the Services at any time, including introducing new features or removing existing ones. Some features may be marked as beta, preview, “coming soon,” or similar. Beta features are provided for evaluation and may be incomplete or unstable. Gigabrain does not guarantee uninterrupted availability and may experience downtime, errors, or delays.

    14.2. Gigabrain does not issue, sell, distribute, or redeem the $BRAIN token through the Services, and does not operate or control any secondary market for the $BRAIN token. Gigabrain makes no representations regarding the value, price, liquidity, availability, or market performance of the $BRAIN token, and does not guarantee that any token-gated features or benefits will be maintained indefinitely.

15. **Disclaimers** 

    15.1. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GIGABRAIN DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

    15.2. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, GIGABRAIN DOES NOT WARRANT THAT: (a) THE SERVICES OR ANY OUTPUTS WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, COMPLETE, OR TIMELY; (b) THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE; (c) ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR (d) USE OF THE SERVICES WILL RESULT IN ANY PARTICULAR OUTCOME, INCLUDING PROFITABILITY OR LOSS AVOIDANCE.

    15.3. You acknowledge that: (a) outputs may include errors, omissions, or uncertainty; (b) market data may be delayed or inaccurate; and (c) commentary reflects analysis rather than certainty.

    15.4. Your use of the Services does not create any fiduciary, advisory, brokerage, agency, or trust relationship between you and Gigabrain. Any integration or automation operates only according to user-configured parameters and does not constitute asset management or discretionary trading by Gigabrain. Gigabrain does not act on your behalf, does not manage assets for you, and does not owe you any duty of care beyond providing access to the Services in accordance with these Terms. You acknowledge that you remain solely responsible for evaluating information, managing risk, and making decisions based on your own judgment.

    15.5. The Services and any outputs generated through them are provided for informational and educational purposes only. Nothing provided by Gigabrain constitutes, or should be construed as, financial, investment, legal, tax, or other professional advice. Gigabrain does not recommend or endorse any asset, strategy, transaction, or course of action. You are solely responsible for conducting your own research, seeking independent professional advice where appropriate, and making your own decisions regarding any trading or investment activity. Without limiting the foregoing, nothing in the Services or these Terms should be interpreted as encouraging the purchase, holding, or sale of any token, including the $BRAIN token. Any decision to acquire or dispose of tokens is made independently by you and at your own risk. Any reliance you place on the Services or their outputs is at your own risk.

16. **Limitation of Liability** 

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL GIGABRAIN OR ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, TRADING LOSSES, DIMINUTION IN VALUE, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) THE SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GIGABRAIN’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO GIGABRAIN FOR THE SERVICES IN THE 12 (TWELVE) MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM; OR (B) US$ 100 (ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS), UNLESS A DIFFERENT CAP IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

17. **Indemnification** 

    17.1. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Gigabrain, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, and service providers from and against any claims, demands, actions, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your User Content or configurations, including any workflows, automation rules, or configuration parameters you create or enable; (c) your reliance on any outputs, analysis, commentary, or information generated through the Services; (d) any trading activity you initiate or authorize through third party platforms; (e) your violation of these Terms or any applicable law; or (f) your infringement of any third party rights.

    17.2. Gigabrain reserves the right to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification, in which case you agree to cooperate fully with Gigabrain.

18. **Suspension & Termination** 

    18.1. Gigabrain may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to the Services, in whole or in part, at any time and without prior notice if Gigabrain reasonably determines that: (a) you have violated these Terms; (b) your use of the Services poses a security, operational, or reputational risk; (c) your activity interferes with the integrity, availability, or proper functioning of the Services; (d) required to do so by applicable law, sanctions obligations, or contractual requirements with third party service providers; or (e) you no longer meet eligibility or token-gating requirements.

    18.2. Suspension or termination may include disabling access to features, terminating workflows or automation, revoking token-gated entitlements, or preventing further interaction with the Services. You acknowledge that Gigabrain is not responsible for losses resulting from suspension or termination, including any impact on third party transactions or automations you have configured.

    18.3. You may stop using the Services at any time. Upon termination, your license to use the Services will immediately cease. Provisions which by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and indemnification.

19. **Privacy** 

Your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use, and share personal data. If there is a conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Policy regarding personal data handling, the Privacy Policy governs.

20. **Changes to Terms** 

We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last Updated” date and may provide additional notice through the Services. Your continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.

21. **Governing Law & Jurisdiction** 

    21.1. In the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute informally through good-faith negotiation. If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to [support@gigabrain.gg](mailto:support@gigabrain.gg), so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution. If we aren't able to reach an informal resolution within 60 (sixty) days of your email, then you and we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the process set forth herein.

    21.2. These Terms, and all matters or disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, the subject matter hereof or the activities of you or Gigabrain in connection with or contemplated by these Terms, including your access and use of the Services (including any act or omission related thereto) shall be governed and construed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands. The courts of the British Virgin Islands shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with these Terms or their subject matter or formation.

22. **Miscellaneous**

    22.1. **Entire Agreement.** These Terms, the Privacy Policy and the Risk Disclosure, along with any other policies or guidelines that Gigabrain publishes or makes available through the Platform from time to time, constitute the entire agreement between you and Gigabrain with respect to the Services, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, or arrangements, whether oral or written, regarding the Services. 

    22.2. **Maintenance of Platform.** Your access to and use of the Platform may occasionally be interrupted for various reasons, including but not limited to maintenance, updates, repairs, or upgrades initiated by Gigabrain. While we endeavour to notify users of scheduled maintenance activities whenever feasible, urgent maintenance may occur without prior notice. During such maintenance periods, the availability or functionality of certain features of the Services may be temporarily affected. Gigabrain strives to minimize disruptions and will schedule maintenance during off-peak hours whenever possible to maintain the optimal performance, security, and functionality of the Services.

    22.3. **Waiver.** The failure of Gigabrain to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Gigabrain.

    22.4. **Severability.** If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions, which shall continue in full force and effect.

    22.5. **Assignment.** You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Gigabrain may freely assign or transfer its rights and obligations under these Terms without restriction, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law.

    22.6. **Relationship of the Parties.** These Terms do not create a joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and Gigabrain. Both parties act independently and have no authority to bind the other in any respect.

    22.7. **Force Majeure.** Gigabrain shall not be liable for any failure or delay resulting from any circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, governmental actions or acts of terrorism, civil disturbances, labour conditions, power failures, internet interruptions, mechanical or data processing failures or other unforeseen events.

    22.8. **Construction.** The rule of construction that a contract should be interpreted against the party responsible for its drafting shall not apply.

    22.9. **Survival.** The provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination, including but not limited to indemnity, disclaimers, limitations of liability, intellectual property rights, governing law, and miscellaneous provisions, shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms.

    22.10. **Electronic Communications.** By creating an account or using the Services, you consent to receive all notices, disclosures, agreements, records, statements, and other communications (“**Electronic Communications**”) in electronic form. Electronic Communications may be delivered via email to the email address associated with your account or through notifications or messages displayed via your user dashboard on the Platform or any other electronic method reasonably designed to provide notice to you.

You agree that all Electronic Communications provided by Gigabrain shall satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing, and you waive any right to insist on receiving communications in paper or non-electronic form, except where applicable law specifically requires otherwise. You are responsible for ensuring that your email address and all other contact information associated with your account are accurate, current, and capable of receiving Electronic Communications.

    22.11. **Reporting.** If you identify any vulnerabilities, security issues, or concerns regarding the Services, please report them promptly by contacting [support@gigabrain.gg](mailto:support@gigabrain.gg). Your cooperation helps us maintain a secure and reliable Platform.
