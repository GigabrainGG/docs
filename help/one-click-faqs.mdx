## ðŸ›  Trade Execution

<Accordion title="Why is my order sometimes executed as a market order instead of a limit order?">
  **Example:** BTC is trading at \$85K. You want to long at \$90K.\
  â€¢ A **limit order** at \$90K would fill immediately because the market is already below.\
  â€¢ A **stop-limit** is required to trigger only when price reaches \$90K.\
  However, Hyperliquid currently doesnâ€™t support linking TP/SL orders to stop-based entries. Managing separate contingent orders exceeds API rate limits.
</Accordion>

## ðŸ“Š Position Management

<Accordion title="What does the Delete button on an open-position card do, and when should I use it?">
  **Function:** Permanently removes the position record from the Gigabrain terminal.\
  **Use it when:**\
  â€¢ Youâ€™ve manually closed the trade on Hyperliquid, but it still shows in the terminal\
  â€¢ You want to remove historical or irrelevant entries for clarity
