## ðŸ›  Trade Execution

### **Why is my order sometimes executed as a market order instead of a limit order?**

**Example:** BTC is trading at \$85K. You want to long at \$90K.\
â€¢ A **limit order** at \$90K would fill immediately because the market is already below.\
â€¢ A **stop-limit** is required to trigger only when price reaches \$90K.\
However, Hyperliquid currently doesnâ€™t support linking TP/SL orders to stop-based entries. Managing separate contingent orders exceeds API rate limits.

## ðŸ“Š Position Management

### **What does the Delete button on an open-position card do, and when should I use it?**

**Function:** Permanently removes the position record from the Gigabrain terminal.\
**Use it when:**\
â€¢ Youâ€™ve manually closed the trade on Hyperliquid, but it still shows in the terminal\
â€¢ You want to remove historical or irrelevant entries for clarity

### **Can I disable invalidations after my position is live?**

Yes. Use the toggle in the top-right corner of the position card to disable **Invalidation**.\
Once disabled, the agent will no longer manage or exit the trade, even if the trade thesis is broken.

### **Can I modify my Stop-Loss (SL) and Take-Profit (TP) levels?**

Yes. Click **Modify Position** on the position card to adjust SL and TP parameters during a live trade.

## ðŸ§  Signal Behavior

### **Why donâ€™t some Alpha cards have an Open Trade button?**

Only signals with a status of **Open** or **Active** display the "Open Trade" button.\
Signals marked **Won**, **Lost**, or **Cancelled** are historical and not eligible for execution.

### **Where can I review the agentâ€™s actions on my position?**

All automated activity â€” entries, exits, modifications, and cancellations â€” is recorded under **Brain Activity**.\
Example:\
`â†’ Cancelled BNBâ€‘PERP | Reason: trade thesis invalidated`

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Metrics

### **How is my win rate calculated?**

Win rate only includes trades that were both **opened and closed through the Gigabrain terminal**.\
If you close a trade manually on Hyperliquid, itâ€™s marked as **Cancelled** and excluded from your win-loss metrics.
