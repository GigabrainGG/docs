## Auto-Trade FAQs

<AccordionGroup>

    - Your **existing Long** position size will **increase** by the Auto-Trade order size.
    - Your **existing Short** position size will **decrease** by the Auto-Trade order size.

    **If Auto-Trade opens a Short position:**

    - Your **existing Long** position size will **decrease** by the Auto-Trade order size.
    - Your **existing Short** position size will **increase** by the Auto-Trade order size.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is the entry price for my trade different from the strategy's entry price?">
    Entry prices may differ due to slight delays in order execution timing. Auto-Trade executes trades as signals are received, but network conditions and fills can vary per user.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is trade size determined for each auto-executed order?">
    Trades are opened based on proportion**of your total assigned value** . This ensures consistent risk management.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change the amount I’ve subscribed to a strategy?">
    Yes. To change the allocation:

    - **Unsubscribe** from the strategy.
    - **Re-subscribe** with new amount.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many trades should I expect from Auto-Trade?">
    - **Ramanujan Strategy**: ~4–5 high-conviction trades per week.
    - **Agent Strategies**: Varies by strategy type and market conditions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if there are no active trades in the strategy, but I still have open positions on Hyperliquid opened by auto trade?">
    This can happen due to API rate limits. You may manually close any leftover trades on your Hyperliquid account if they weren’t successfully closed by Auto-Trade.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='Why does the master account show trades as "active" while my subscriber order remains "open" and not executed?'>
    Orders placed through Auto-Trade follow Hyperliquid's standard order queue system. The master account's orders are placed first in the queue due to system architecture, which means:

    - **Master orders** are filled first when market conditions allow
    - **Subscriber orders** are filled subsequently, based on their position in the queue
    - **Market liquidity** and volatility can affect fill rates for all orders in the queue
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="If only 10% of my allocated capital is being used for trades, should I withdraw the remaining idle capital from Hyperliquid?">
    We strongly recommend keeping your full allocated capital in your Hyperliquid account. Here's why:

    - **Liquidation Protection:** Maintaining excess capital provides a safety buffer against potential liquidations
    - **Strategy Flexibility:** Auto-Trade may require additional capital for larger position sizes or multiple concurrent trades
    - **Risk Management:** Higher account equity improves your overall risk profile and margin requirements

    Withdrawing idle capital significantly increases your liquidation risk and may compromise the effectiveness of the Auto-Trade strategy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are my Auto-Trade orders guaranteed to be filled once placed?">
    **No, order fills are not guaranteed.** Order execution depends entirely on Hyperliquid's liquidity conditions and is beyond our control:

    - **Market Liquidity:** Insufficient liquidity may prevent order fills
    - **Price Movement:** Rapid market movements can cause orders to remain unfilled
    - **Order Type:** Limit orders may not execute if price targets aren't reached

    Auto-Trade places orders according to the strategy, but actual execution depends on prevailing market conditions on the Hyperliquid liquidity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to subscriber open orders if the master account order gets filled but subscriber orders don't get filled?">
    **Unfilled subscriber orders are automatically cancelled after 1 minute.**\
    \
    Here's how the process works:\
    **Master order fills:** The strategy position becomes active in the master account.\
    **Subscriber orders remain unfilled:** Due to market conditions or liquidity constraints.\
    **Automatic cancellation:** All unfilled subscriber orders are cancelled after 1 minute to prevent stale orders.\
    **Position synchronization:** This ensures subscribers don't have outdated orders that could execute at unfavorable prices.

    This automatic cancellation mechanism protects subscribers from executing orders that may no longer align with the current market conditions or strategy timing.

## One Click Trade FAQ

### Trade Execution

<Accordion title="Why is my order sometimes executed as a market order instead of a limit order?">
  **Example:** BTC is trading at \$85K. You want to long at \$90K.\
  • A **limit order** at \$90K would fill immediately because the market is already below.\
  • A **stop-limit** is required to trigger only when price reaches \$90K.\
  However, Hyperliquid currently doesn’t support linking TP/SL orders to stop-based entries. Managing separate contingent orders exceeds API rate limits.
</Accordion>

### Position Management

<Accordion title="What does the Delete button on an open-position card do, and when should I use it?">
  **Function:** Permanently removes the position record from the Gigabrain terminal.\

  • You want to remove historical or irrelevant entries for clarity
